In 2015-2019, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship in Dr Alexander Rauscher’s lab (UBC), where I was able to add a wide variety of MRI techniques to my skill-set, and applied them in various subject groups. My postdoctoral research was mainly focused on combining diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), myelin water imaging (MWI), and susceptibility based imaging techniques (such as quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R$_{2}^{*}$ mapping) in novel ways to better understand white matter damage and development. Work from that time resulted in a publication in \textit{Frontiers in Neurology},  which used DTI and QSM, along with previously published MWI results from the same study, to persuasively demonstrate that varsity ice-hockey concussion damage seen at two-weeks post-injury was likely a result of myelin sheaths ‘loosening’, or ‘unraveling’, as opposed to complete disintegration, as previously thought. This publication gained significant attention in the media, for which I was interviewed for three television interviews (two for Global News and one on CityTV’s Breakfast Television).

I was appointed an Independent Investigator at BCCHR in July 2019, and in June 2020 was appointed as Assistant Professor (Partner) in the Dept of Pediatrics, UBC. I spent the first year (2019-2020) setting up my lab, finishing up previous work and publishing papers, as well as started networking and collaborating on potential new projects. I submitted several grants as PI (Brain Canada, CIHR Catalyst Grant, NSERC Discovery Grant) and joined several grants as co-applicant. I also started a monthly MRI Journal Club, taught a course in Clinical Research Methods, and hired a co-op student at the beginning of the summer of 2020. I have since established myself as: i) an expert in measuring cerebrovascular health in the brain using novel MRI techniques; ii) an expert in the fractal nature of brain signalling using functional MRI; and a jack-of-all-trades with respect to multi-modal quantitative MRI. I have been the Primary Supervisor for several graduate and undergraduate students, all of whom have graduated on time, and have published first-author manuscripts. For the winter 2024 semester, I taught a graduate course I developed for the Women+ and Children's Health Sciences program: WACH505 - Fundamentals of Magnetic Resonance Imaging. In 2024 I received an NSERC Discovery Grant to continue my fractal analysis research in the developing brain.

Imaging the developing brain is an exciting and challenging field that I am passionate about. With greater technological advances in perinatal and neonatal care, more preterm infants are being born and surviving into adulthood. Up to half of preterm infants develop neurological, cognitive, and motor deficits later in life. At the same time, infants born at term are also susceptible to acquired brain injuries. Better understanding of this critical period in brain growth could shed light on both normal fetal brain development and neural plasticity and compensation from injuries. Furthermore, sensitive and specific imaging markers for brain tissue and repair are crucial for measuring potential treatment effects objectively and early.

\textbf{March 2020 to March 2022: }The global COVID-19 pandemic delayed my
progress in establishing my independent research program: it forced me to work
from home, affected my mental health, reduced face-to-face interactions with
other researchers on a daily basis, reduced time spent at the MRI Centre, made
recruitment of volunteers more difficult, and more.

\label{8. Teaching}

Through teaching, I hope to share with my students a deep understanding of not only why we believe what we believe today, but also show them how we got there, and hopefully motivate them to push into new levels of understanding. In order to properly educate, one must be both informed of and ready to apply the most up-to-date evidence-based pedagogical practices. Thus, I strive to continuously improve upon what I have learned, and to keep up with the field. True learning, however, appears to occur when students are actively engaged with the content (Hake, 1997; Wieman, 2014). This means that, as a lecturer, I aim to fill my class time with activities that have been proven to engage and motivate, encourage collaboration, and reach higher levels of learning - such as analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating - across factual, conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive knowledge.
\\

My biggest accomplishment in Teaching has been developing, from scratch, a graduate program for the Women+ and Children’s Health Sciences: WACH505 - Fundamentals of Magnetic Resonance Imaging. See below for more details.

\textbf{Precision Health Analysis Bootcamp: Fmri Analysis Parts I \& II:} The focus of this course/bootcamp is to first explain the basic concepts behind functional MRI, and then focus on the data preprocessing and core tools/file formats. A tutorial portion with live coding helps students understand how to create a python virtual environment, install a singularity image, and how to call singularity inside a PBS script. The second session focused on freesurfer and DTI preprocessing: both as a lecture explaining the basic concepts, and as a tutorial on how to run modules and programs on Sockeye at UBC.

\textbf{WACH 505: Fundamentals of Magnetic Resonance Imaging:} This course introduces students to the basic concepts underlying magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The course starts with a historical overview of medical imaging in general, leading to the development of MRI. It then introduces basic physical concepts used in MRI and some of the basic principles. Expanding on these concepts, we cover image weighting and contrast, special encoding and image formation, parameters and pulse sequences, instrumentation, and equipment. Students learn what magnetic resonance phenomenon is, how magnetic resonance signals are generated, how an image can be made using MRI, and how soft tissue contrast can change with imaging parameters. We also introduce MR imaging sequences of spin echo, gradient echo, fast spin echo, echo planar imaging, inversion recovery, etc. Finally, we cover more advanced MRI techniques such as functional, diffusion, quantitative, phase-based, spectroscopy MRI, and more. As there are no prerequisites for this course, all concepts are taught and explained in an intuitive format with minimal mathematics.

In addition to the teaching described above, I am an associate member in the Department of Neuroscience and The School of Biomedical Engineering at UBC. Through my supervision of students doing research with me, I teach the physics of MR imaging, its application in biomedical research, statistical concepts, software programming and troubleshooting, the philosophy and practice of science, as well as writing skills. This informal teaching occurs in one-on-one discussions, group discussions, weekly lab meetings, and various assignments.

Expanding on these concepts, we then cover image weighting and contrast, special encoding and image formation, parameters and pulse sequences, instrumentation, and equipment.  Students learn what magnetic resonance phenomenon is, how magnetic resonance signals are generated, how an image can be made using MRI, and how soft tissue contrast can change with imaging parameters. Also introduced are MR imaging sequences of spin echo, gradient echo, fast spin echo, echo planar imaging, inversion recovery, etc. Finally, we cover more advanced MRI techniques such as functional, diffusion, quantitative, phase-based, spectroscopy MRI, and more.

\noindent \textbf{Summary}


As a pediatric imaging researcher, my main goals are to better understand MRI contrast mechanisms in order to develop novel imaging and post-processing techniques that aim to improve sensitivity and specificity of biophysical properties of the brain. My goal is to then use these techniques to better understand differences or changes in white matter in the injured or unhealthy pediatric brain, which can then be used to improve our basic knowledge of the brain, early diagnoses, and to track disease progress with new treatments. I will work to create infrastructure to provide access and education to clinical researchers who want to engage in using imaging to understand complex neurological and developmental disorders, and to create knowledge translation pathways, such as simple-to-use pipelines in order to better integrate advanced post-processing into the clinical imaging arsenal at BCCH.

My main intent is to develop excellence in imaging research so that UBC/BCCHRI becomes a leader in pediatric imaging. I believe we have a centre and the resources to achieve this goal. My aim is to serve as a Scientific Lead by: 1) developing my own independent career research interests; and 2) taking on the development and management of affiliated onsite research projects.

Specifically, my research plan over the next five years is to continue 1) investigating cerebrovascular health by making advances in SWI/QSM research; 2) continue studying long range temporal correlations in fMRI; and 3) using advanced multimodal MRI to improve pediatric brain research. For 1), my next project involves using deep learning algorithms to recover unfiltered phase data from clinical SWI scans which would allow for retrospective analysis of iron levels in preterm infants. I am also working with Thiviya Selvanathan on using SWI to study neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. For 2), I will spend the next 5 years trying to understand (i) structural brain recovery using SWI and DWI methods and ii) functional brain recovery using fMRI LRTC analysis, over the first year of life. Currently we are writing a critical review of complexity analysis in fMRI, and publishing a study demonstrating necessary methodologies to improve and standardize the field. Next, depending on funding, I will either recruit and scan a longitudinal cohort of very preterm infants to complete this project, or will leverage open access data such as the Lifespan Baby Connectome Project. Finally, for 3) I plan to continue to collaborate with colleagues on various projects, including: Thiviya Selvanathan (HIE in newborns - CIHR Project Grant; HIE followup); Alexander Rauscher (Concussion – CIHR Project Grant); Jill Zwicker (DCD brain developement); Liisa Holsti (COMFORT MRI); Anita Datta and Gabriella Horvath (Rett); and more.

\label{10. Service to University}

I am interested in helping BC Children's Hospital and the MRI Research Centre at UBC
become a leader in pediatric MR Imaging. This work includes networking with clinicians and other researchers interested 
in advancing UBC's capabilities in terms of state-of-the-art advanced imaging. 
Educating, communicating, writing grants, purchasing new equipment, running brainstorm sessions, seminars and mini-conferences; 
these and more are needed in order to bring us up to a world-class level. 
As well, I strive to reach out to national and international researchers in order to collaborate on multi-site projects. 
I have spent the last nine years collaborating and working with people from both Children's Hospital and UBC MRI Research Centre,
as well as attending and presenting at meetings, conferences, update sessions, and more. 
%I have helped write a large grant with Dr. Rauscher and other clinicians at Children's Hospital named the BC Children Imaging Program, 
%which seeks to develop new scientific methods for MRI data acquisition and analysis, and to share these methods collaboratively with scientists at BC-CHRI and beyond.
I have developed, from scratch, a graduate course teaching the fundamentals of MRI (Women+ and Children's Health Program).
I created this course because I have seen how many students begin and conduct their research in magnetic resonance imaging without ever knowing how an MRI actually works.
Thus, I saw a need to develop a course that would be open to all students from any department and with no prerequisites.
This course has also provides a much needed opportunity for other faculty to teach: in its inaugural year (W2024), I had five Faculty members give guest lectures (Alexander Rauscher, Shannon Kolind, Andrew Yung, Rachel Eddy, Thiviya Selvanathan).

My service to the community has generally been in mental health. 
I started volunteering in undergrad in a neuroscience nursing ward, 
which helped spark a passion of mine for both neuroscience and mental health in general, 
but also for working directly with clients who are dealing with these issues on a daily basis.
I believe that volunteering gives us an opportunity to give back to the community,
but also to see a side of the world that we may be privileged enough not to have had to see.
Thus, there is so much to learn from volunteering in different fields and getting to know people who struggle with various issues.
Although it can be seen below that I have not had much service to the academic community,
I believe that service to the oppressed or disadvantaged community is as important.

In the field of MRI, publication is mainly in specialized journals which have
impact factors ranging between 2 and 6. For example, Magnetic Resonance in
Medicine, which is the leading journal in the field, has an impact factor of
3.6. It is very rare that MRI scientists publish in the top journals Nature and
Science. I am only aware of two recent papers (“Travelling-wave nuclear
magnetic resonance”, Brunner et al. Nature 2009 and “Magnetic resonance
fingerprinting”, Ma et al. Nature 2013.) The highest impact an MRI method can
have is when it is adopted by MRI scanner manufacturers and used in thousands
of patients.

In my spare time, I like to get outdoors and learn new things. I am passionate
about exploring mountains in different seasons and in different forms: hiking,
trail running, rock climbing, ice climbing, skiing, canoeing, etc. Not only are
these sports challenging, fun and exciting, but they often involve complex
skill and technical knowledge building, humility, preparedness, first aid and
survival know-how, determination, the willingness to fail over and over again
in safe environments in order to learn, leaderships skills, teamwork, trust,
and more. As well, more and more studies are showing not only the physical and
mental health benefits of exercise, but also of being in nature. I enjoy
sharing my stories of success and failure, of learning and growth, and the
benefits of challenging yourself and the beauty of the outdoors.
