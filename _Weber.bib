HFV is characterized by delivering tidal volumes close to or less than the anatomical dead space. Both animal and clinical studies have shown that HFV can effectively restore lung function, and potentially limit ventilator-induced lung injury, which is considered an important risk factor for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Knowledge of how HFV works, how it influences cardiorespiratory physiology, and how to apply it in daily clinical practice has proven to be essential for its optimal and safe use. We will present important aspects of gas exchange, lung-protective concepts, clinical use, and possible adverse effects of HFV. We also discuss the study results on the use of HFV in respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants and respiratory failure in term neonates.

We measured BBB permeability using i.v. injection Evans Blue (EB) and the extent of inflammation using immunohistochemical techniques identifying neutrophils (monoclonal antibody RP-3) and the endothelial adhesion molecule, E-selectin. Male Sprague-Dawley immature (17 day-old) rats (30-45 g, n = 80) were subjected to a controlled cortical impact (CCI: 2 mm, 4 m/s), a closed head diffuse injury (DI: 150 g/2m) or a corresponding sham procedure (with or without craniotomy). EB was injected i.v. at 30 min before sacrifice, which occurred at 1 h, 4 h, or 24 h after injury. BBB permeability was observed in both the CCI and DI rats at 1 h after injury which largely resolved by 24 h. In the CCI, EB extravasation was seen within and around the contusion. In DI, diffuse BBB permeability was seen. DI was not associated with acute inflammation since there was neither neutrophil accumulation nor E-selectin expression. The CCI rats though had 5.1 +/- 2.2 neutrophils/hpf and 3.0 +/- 0.4 endothelial cells/hpf expressing E-selectin (mean +/- SEM) (both p {$<$} 0.05 vs sham and DI). These data suggest that BBB breakdown occurs in the immature rat after both focal and diffuse TBI. This early BBB permeability was not associated with acute inflammation in DI but was in CCI. These data also suggest that contusion is a key factor in the development of a traditional acute inflammatory response after TBI in the immature rat.},

  abstract = {A sensitive and accurate imaging technique capable of tracking the disease progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) driven amnestic dementia would be beneficial. A currently available method for pathology detection in AD with high accuracy is Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, despite certain limitations such as low spatial resolution, off-targeting error, and radiation exposure. Non-invasive MRI scanning with quantitative magnetic susceptibility measurements can be used as a complementary tool. To date, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has widely been used in tracking deep gray matter iron accumulation in AD. The present work proposes that by compartmentalizing quantitative susceptibility into paramagnetic and diamagnetic components, more holistic information about AD pathogenesis can be acquired. Particularly, diamagnetic component susceptibility (DCS) can be a powerful indicator for tracking protein accumulation in the gray matter (GM), demyelination in the white matter (WM), and relevant changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In the current work, voxel-wise group analysis of the WM and the CSF regions show significantly lower \textbar DCS\textbar{} (the absolute value of DCS) value for amnestic dementia patients compared to healthy controls. Additionally, \textbar DCS\textbar{} and {$\tau$} PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) were found to be associated in several GM regions typically affected by {$\tau$} deposition in AD. Therefore, we propose that the separated diamagnetic susceptibility can be used to track pathological neurodegeneration in different tissue types and regions of the brain. With the initial evidence, we believe the usage of compartmentalized susceptibility demonstrates substantive potential as an MRI-based technique for tracking AD-driven neurodegeneration.},

In 2010, all 26 tertiary level Neonatal Follow-Up clinics joined the Canadian Neonatal Follow-Up Network (CNFUN) and agreed to implement a standardized assessment (including the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III (Bayley-III) at 18 months corrected age for children born {$<$} 29 weeks' gestation. It is unknown whether the variability in follow-up practices lessened as a result. OBJECTIVES: To describe the current status of neonatal follow-up services in Canada and changes over time. METHODS: A comprehensive online survey was sent to all tertiary level CNFUN Follow-up programs. Questions were based on previous survey results, current literature, and investigator expertise and consensus. RESULTS: Respondents included 23 of 26 (88\%) CNFUN programs. All sites provide neurodevelopmental screening and referrals in a multidisciplinary setting with variations in staffing. CNFUN programs vary with most offering five to seven visits. Since 2006, assessments at 18 months CA increased from 84\% to 91\% of sites, Bayley-III use increased from 21\% to 74\% (P=0.001) and eligibility for follow-up was expanded for children with stroke, congenital diaphragmatic hernia and select anomalies detected in utero. Audit data is collected by {$>$} 80\% of tertiary programs. CONCLUSION: Care became more consistent after CNFUN; 18-month assessments and Bayley-III use increased significantly. However, marked variability in follow-up practices persists.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Germinal matrix intraventricular hemorrhage is a common complication of prematurity. An underrecognized complication of germinal matrix intraventricular hemorrhage is superficial siderosis, and the clinical consequences of superficial siderosis are not well-known. We aimed to investigate the prevalence, anatomic distribution, and severity of superficial siderosis and ependymal siderosis in premature infants with germinal matrix intraventricular hemorrhage using SWI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included 88 patients across all grades of germinal matrix intraventricular hemorrhage who underwent MR imaging at term-equivalent age. Images were evaluated for the presence, distribution, and severity of superficial siderosis and ependymal siderosis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine factors associated with superficial siderosis and ependymal siderosis. The agreement among T1, T2, and SWI sequences was examined. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients had brain stem superficial siderosis, and 79 patients had ependymal siderosis. The presence, extent, and severity of superficial siderosis and ependymal siderosis were closely related to the grade of germinal matrix intraventricular hemorrhage and intraventricular hematoma volume. Brain stem superficial siderosis had a stronger correlation with intraventricular hemorrhage than with cerebellar hemorrhage. Compared with SWI, T1 and T2 sequences detected only small proportions of patients with superficial siderosis (12.5\% and 6.9\%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of superficial siderosis and ependymal siderosis is very high in preterm infants with germinal matrix intraventricular hemorrhage when assessed by SWI at term-equivalent age. The presence and extent of superficial siderosis and ependymal siderosis are closely related to germinal matrix intraventricular hemorrhage grade and intraventricular hematoma volume. Additional prospective studies using SWI are needed to clearly determine the clinical consequences of germinal matrix intraventricular hemorrhage with superficial siderosis and ependymal siderosis.},

  abstract = {This work details the observation of non-Gaussian apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) profiles in multi-direction, diffusion-weighted MR data acquired with easily achievable imaging parameters (b approximately 1000 s/mm(2)). A technique is described for modeling the profile of the ADC over the sphere, which can capture non-Gaussian effects that can occur at, for example, intersections of different tissue types or white matter fiber tracts. When these effects are significant, the common diffusion tensor model is inappropriate, since it is based on the assumption of a simple underlying diffusion process, which can be described by a Gaussian probability density function. A sequence of models of increasing complexity is obtained by truncating the spherical harmonic (SH) expansion of the ADC measurements at several orders. Further, a method is described for selection of the most appropriate of these models, in order to describe the data adequately but without overfitting. The combined procedure is used to classify the profile at each voxel as isotropic, anisotropic Gaussian, or non-Gaussian, each with reference to the underlying probability density function of displacement of water molecules. We use it to show that non-Gaussian profiles arise consistently in various regions of the human brain where complex tissue structure is known to exist, and can be observed in data typical of clinical scanners. The performance of the procedure developed is characterized using synthetic data in order to demonstrate that the observed effects are genuine. This characterization validates the use of our method as an indicator of pathology that affects tissue structure, which will tend to reduce the complexity of the selected model.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adolescence is a critical period of brain structural reorganisation and maturation of cognitive abilities. This relatively late developmental reorganisation may be altered in individuals who were born preterm. METHODS: We carried out longitudinal neuropsychological testing in 94 very preterm individuals (VPT; before 33 weeks' gestation) and 44 term born individuals at mean ages of 15.3 years (adolescence) and 19.5 years (young adulthood). RESULTS: Full scale, verbal and performance IQ and phonological verbal fluency were significantly lower in the VPT group than the term group at both ages. Repeated measures ANOVA showed only one group by time point interaction for semantic verbal fluency (F = 10.25; df = 107; p = 0.002). Paired-sample t tests showed that semantic verbal fluency increased significantly in the term group over adolescence (t = -5.10; df = 42; p{$<$}0.001), but did not increase in the VPT group (t = 0.141; df = 69; p = 0.889). For verbal IQ, there was a significant interaction between time point and sex (F = 4.48; df = 1; p = 0.036) with paired-sample t tests showing that verbal IQ decreased in males between adolescence and adulthood (t = 3.35; df = 71; p = 0.001), but did not change significantly in females (t = 0.20; df = 52; p = 0.845). CONCLUSION: Decrements of intellectual functioning in VPT individuals persist into adulthood. Additionally, there is a deficit in the adolescent maturation of semantic verbal fluency in individuals born VPT.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Myelin water fraction (MWF) mapping based on multi-gradient recalled-echo (MGRE) imaging has been proposed as an alternative to the conventional multi-echo-spin-echo (MESE) approach. In this work, we performed a comparative study of MESE and MGRE-derived MWFs in the same subject group. METHODS: MESE and MGRE data were acquired in 12 healthy volunteers at 3T. T2* decay curves were corrected for the effects of field inhomogeneities and multicomponent analysis of T2~ and T2* signals was performed using non-negative least-squares fitting. RESULTS: When comparing MGRE and MESE-MWFs across volunteers, no significant differences were observed between average values in WM, deep GM (dGM), and cortical GM (cGM) that were (14\,\textpm\,3\%), (6\,\textpm\,2\%), and (8\,\textpm\,2\%) for MGRE, and (13\,\textpm\,2\%), (6\,\textpm\,1\%), and (7\,\textpm\,1\%), respectively, for MESE. The MGRE and MESE-MWFs showed a strong correlation (r2 \,=\,0.84) and Bland-Altman analysis revealed a small positive bias of (0.8\,\textpm\,1.6\%) (absolute difference) for the MGRE-MWF. CONCLUSION: Overall, we observed excellent agreement between the two techniques. The small positive bias of the MGRE-MWF is thought to be a consequence of its potentially reduced sensitivity to water exchange effects, compared to the MESE-MWF. This work suggests that with careful correction for the effects of field inhomogeneities, MGRE-MWF imaging is a promising alternative to the MESE approach.

Although experimental data suggest that the newborn brain may be more resistant to ischemic injury than the adult brain, the minimum CBF necessary to sustain neuronal viability in newborn infants is unknown. We have measured CBF with positron emission tomography in 16 preterm and 14 term newborn infants and have determined the relationship between CBF and subsequent brain function as assessed by neurological examination and developmental assessment. The range of mean CBF in the preterm infants was 4.9 to 23 ml/(100 gm {$\cdot$} min) and the range of mean CBF in the term infants was 9.0 to 73 ml/(100 gm {$\cdot$} min). Five preterm infants and one term infant with mean CBF less than 10 ml/(100 gm {$\cdot$} min) survived. Three of these 5 preterm infants, with mean CBF of 4.9, 5.2, and 9.3 ml/ (100 gm {$\cdot$} min, respectively, have normal neurological examinations and Bayley Scales of 80 or greater at 6, 6, and 24 months of age, respectively. One (mean CBF 6.9) has normal cognitive development (Bayley 103) and a mild spastic diplegia at age 19 months, and one infant (mean CBF 6.2) has a left hemiparesis and a Binet IQ score of 70 at age 33 months. The term infant, with a mean CBF of 9.0 ml/(100 gm {$\cdot$} min), was developing normally when he died of Septembersis at age 5 months. These data indicate that mean CBF as low as 5 ml/(100 gm {$\cdot$} min) in newborn infants can be associated with normal subsequent neurological development and therefore with preservation of a substantial number of cortical/ neurons. Since the minimal CBF below this value necessary to maintain neuronal viability in newborn infants remains to be determined, measurements of CBF in the newborn period should not be used in determination of brain death.},

METHODS: Cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) was measured with positron emission tomography in 11 sick newborns of different gestational ages. RESULTS: In five preterm infants, mean hemispheric CMRO2 was 0.06 to 0.54 mL 100 g-1 min-1. Two of these preterm infants with virtually absent CMRO2 (0.06 mL 100 g-1 min-1) had minimal or no evidence of parenchymal brain injury detected in the newborn period. In six term infants, mean hemispheric CMRO2 was 0.0 to 1.3 mL 100 g-1 min-1. Two with no neurological disease had mean hemispheric CMRO2 of 0.4 and 0.7 mL 100 g-1 min-1 and were normal at 6 and 7 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CMRO2 in four newborns who had minimal or no detectable brain injury was considerably below the threshold for brain viability in adults of 1.3 mL 100 g-1 min-1. This indicates that energy requirements in fetal and newborn brain are minimal or can be met by nonoxidative metabolism.},

  abstract = {Rett syndrome (RTT, MIM 312750) is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder and one of the most common causes of mental retardation in females, with an incidence of 1 in 10,000-15,000 (ref. 2). Patients with classic RTT appear to develop normally until 6-18 months of age, then gradually lose speech and purposeful hand use, and develop microcephaly, seizures, autism, ataxia, intermittent hyperventilation and stereotypic hand movements. After initial regression, the condition stabilizes and patients usually survive into adulthood. As RTT occurs almost exclusively in females, it has been proposed that RTT is caused by an X-linked dominant mutation with lethality in hemizygous males. Previous exclusion mapping studies using RTT families mapped the locus to Xq28 (refs 6,9,10,11). Using a systematic gene screening approach, we have identified mutations in the gene (MECP2 ) encoding X-linked methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) as the cause of some cases of RTT. MeCP2 selectively binds CpG dinucleotides in the mammalian genome and mediates transcriptional repression through interaction with histone deacetylase and the corepressor SIN3A (refs 12,13). In 5 of 21 sporadic patients, we found 3 de novo missense mutations in the region encoding the highly conserved methyl-binding domain (MBD) as well as a de novo frameshift and a de novo nonsense mutation, both of which disrupt the transcription repression domain (TRD). In two affected half-sisters of a RTT family, we found segregation of an additional missense mutation not detected in their obligate carrier mother. This suggests that the mother is a germline mosaic for this mutation. Our study reports the first disease-causing mutations in RTT and points to abnormal epigenetic regulation as the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of RTT.},

While numerous cognitive and neuropsychological outcome studies have been published, it is important to consider methodological issues when reviewing this research, as the generalizability of the studies varies greatly. This article describes the nature of cognitive difficulties confronting VP children, both in terms of the frequency and severity of deficits. The breadth of cognitive difficulties reported in this population implies a generalized cognitive impairment; however, the presence of selective or primary cognitive deficits is discussed. It is concluded that whereas mortality and neonatal morbidity rates have decreased significantly in VP infants in recent decades, these children continue to be at significant risk for cognitive impairments and need to be closely monitored throughout childhood.},

This review describes the application of conventional and advanced MRI with very preterm neonates, specifically focusing on the relationship between neonatal MRI findings and later neurodevelopmental outcome. Research demonstrates that conventional MRI is strongly associated with neurodevelopmental outcome in childhood. Further studies are needed to examine the role of advanced MRI techniques in predicting outcome in very preterm children, but early research findings are promising. In conclusion, neonatal MRI is predictive of later neurodevelopment but is dependent on appropriately trained specialists and should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical and social information.},

A problem of echo-planar images is the geometrical distortions that obtain near junctions between tissues of differing magnetic susceptibility. This results in distorted diffusion-tensor maps. To resolve this we suggest acquiring two images for each diffusion gradient; one with bottom-up and one with top-down traversal of k-space in the phase-encode direction. This achieves the simultaneous goals of providing information on the underlying displacement field and intensity maps with adequate spatial sampling density even in distorted areas. The resulting DT maps exhibit considerably higher geometric fidelity, as assessed by comparison to an image volume acquired using a conventional 3D MR technique.},

Recent MRS investigations have adopted a functional approach, where acquisitions of MRS are performed over time to track task-related changes. Previous studies suggest glutamate is of primary interest, as it may play a role during cortical processing of noxious stimuli. The objective of this study was to examine the metabolic effect (i.e., glutamate) in the anterior cingulate cortex during noxious stimulation using fMRS. The analysis addressed changes in glutamate and glutamate\,+\,glutamine (Glx) associated with the onset of pain, and the degree by which fluctuations in metabolites corresponded with continuous pain outcomes. Results suggest healthy participants undergoing tonic noxious stimulation demonstrated increased concentrations of glutamate and Glx at the onset of pain. Subsequent reports of pain were not accompanied by corresponding changes in glutamate of Glx concentrations. An exploratory analysis on sex revealed large effect size changes in glutamate at pain onset in female participants, compared with medium-sized effects in male participants. We propose a role for glutamate in the ACC related to the detection of a noxious stimulus.},

  abstract = {Impact-acceleration forces to the head cause traumatic brain injury (TBI) with damage in white matter tracts comprised of long axons traversing the brain. White matter injury after TBI involves both traumatic axonal injury (TAI) and myelin pathology that evolves throughout the post-injury time course. The axon response to initial mechanical forces and secondary insults follows the process of Wallerian degeneration, which initiates as a potentially reversible phase of intra-axonal damage and proceeds to an irreversible phase of axon fragmentation. Distal to sites of axon disconnection, myelin sheaths remain for prolonged periods, which may activate neuroinflammation and inhibit axon regeneration. In addition to TAI, TBI can cause demyelination of intact axons. These evolving features of axon and myelin pathology also represent opportunities for repair. In experimental TBI, demyelinated axons exhibit remyelination, which can serve to both protect axons and facilitate recovery of function. Myelin remodeling may also contribute to neuroplasticity. Efficient clearance of myelin debris is a potential target to attenuate the progression of chronic pathology. During the early phase of Wallerian degeneration, interventions that prevent the transition from reversible damage to axon disconnection warrant the highest priority, based on the poor regenerative capacity of axons in the CNS. Clinical evaluation of TBI will need to address the challenge of accurately detecting the extent and stage of axon damage. Distinguishing the complex white matter changes associated with axons and myelin is necessary for interpreting advanced neuroimaging approaches and for identifying a broader range of therapeutic opportunities to improve outcome after TBI.},

  abstract = {Evidence of criticality at various levels of neuronal organization has accumulated over the past 2 decades. However, little is known of how criticality affects brain function, whether the critical state is always optimal for information processing, and whether the brain can change its operating point with regards to criticality so as to accommodate varying information processing requirements. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to elucidate mechanisms that regulate brain criticality and to understand their impact on local and global information processing. We empirically validated that the brain can control the level of criticality via neuromodulation, with implications on perception. Then, we relied on computational modeling to gain full control on the parameters that determine criticality, and tested the implications of the level of criticality on two theories of brain function. Last, since excitation/inhibition balance is known to be a crucial determinant of criticality, which can vary across individuals, but also within subjects across time with neuromodulation, we developed a method to non-invasively estimate the functional E/I ratio.},

  abstract = {Background Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) may serve as biomarkers in several diseases. OEF and CMRO2 can be estimated from venous blood oxygenation (Yv) levels, which in turn can be calculated from venous blood T2 values (T2b). T2b can be measured using different MRI sequences, including T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) and T2-prepared-blood-relaxation-imaging-with-inversion-recovery (T2-TRIR). The latter measures both T2b and T1 (T1b) but was found previously to overestimate T2b compared to TRUST. It remained unclear, however, if this bias is constant across higher and lower oxygen saturations. Purpose To compare TRUST and T2-TRIR across a range of O2 saturations using hypoxic and hypercapnic gas challenges. Study Type Prospective. Population Twelve healthy volunteers (four female, age 36 \textpm{} 10 years). Field Strength/Sequence A 3T; turbo-field echo-planar-imaging (TFEPI), echo-planar-imaging (EPI), and fast-field-echo (FFE). Assessment TRUST- and T2-TRIR-derived T2b, Yv, OEF, and CMRO2 were compared across different respiratory challenges. T1b from T2-TRIR was used to estimate Hct (HctTRIR) and compared with venipuncture (HctVP). Statistical Tests Shapiro--Wilk, one-sample and paired-sample t-test, repeated measures ANOVA, Friedman test, Bland--Altman, and correlation analysis. Bonferroni multiple-comparison correction was performed. Significance level was 0.05. Results A significant bias was observed between TRUST- and T2-TRIR-derived T2b, Yv, and OEF values (-13 \textpm{} 11 msec, -5.3\% \textpm{} 3.5\% and 5.9 \textpm{} 4.1\%, respectively). For Yv and OEF, this bias was constant across the range of measured values. T1b was significantly lower during severe hypoxia and hypercapnia compared to baseline (1712 \textpm{} 86 msec and 1634 \textpm{} 79 msec compared to 1757 \textpm{} 90 msec). While no significant bias was found between HctVP and HctTRIR (0.02\% \textpm{} 0.06\%, P = 0.20), the correlation between these Hct values was significant but weak (r = 0.19). Data Conclusion Given the constant bias, TRUST- and T2-TRIR-derived venous T2b values can be used interchangeably to estimate Yv, OEF, and CMRO2 across a broad range of oxygen saturations. Hct from T2-TRIR-derived T1-values only weakly correlated with Hct from venipuncture. Evidence Level 2 Technical Efficacy Stage 2.},

  abstract = {With advances in neonatal care, preterm neonates are surviving with an evolving constellation of motor and cognitive disabilities that appear to be related to widespread cellular maturational disturbances that target cerebral gray and white matter. Whereas preterm infants were previously at high risk for destructive brain lesions that resulted in cystic white matter injury and secondary cortical and subcortical gray matter degeneration, contemporary cohorts of preterm survivors commonly display less severe injury that does not appear to involve pronounced glial or neuronal loss. Nevertheless, these milder forms of injury are also associated with reduced cerebral growth. Recent human and experimental studies support that impaired cerebral growth is related to disparate responses in gray and white matter. Myelination disturbances in cerebral white matter are related to aberrant regeneration and repair responses to acute death of premyelinating late oligodendrocyte progenitors (preOLs). In response to preOL death, early oligodendrocyte progenitors rapidly proliferate and differentiate, but the regenerated preOLs fail to normally mature to myelinating cells required for white matter growth. Although immature neurons appear to be more resistant to cell death from hypoxia-ischemia than glia, they display widespread disturbances in maturation of their dendritic arbors, which further contribute to impaired cerebral growth. These complex and disparate responses of neurons and preOLs thus result in large numbers of cells that fail to fully mature during a critical window in development of neural circuitry. These recently recognized forms of cerebral gray and white matter dysmaturation raise new diagnostic challenges and suggest new therapeutic directions centered on reversal of the processes that promote dysmaturation.},

  abstract = {Hypoxic-ischemic injury to the periventricular cerebral white matter [periventricular leukomalacia (PVL)] results in cerebral palsy and is the leading cause of brain injury in premature infants. The principal feature of PVL is a chronic disturbance of myelination and suggests that oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage progression is disrupted by ischemic injury. We determined the OL lineage stages at risk for injury during the developmental window of vulnerability for PVL (23--32 weeks, postconceptional age). In 26 normal control autopsy human brains, OL lineage progression was defined in parietal white matter, a region of predilection for PVL. Three successive OL stages, the late OL progenitor, the immature OL, and the mature OL, were characterized between 18 and 41 weeks with anti-NG2 proteoglycan, O4, O1, and anti-myelin basic protein (anti-MBP) antibodies. NG2+O4+ late OL progenitors were the predominant stage throughout the latter half of gestation. Between 18 and 27 weeks, O4+O1+ immature OLs were a minor population (9.9 \textpm{} 2.1\% of total OLs;               n               = 9). Between 28 and 41 weeks, an increase in immature OLs to 30.9 \textpm{} 2.1\% of total OLs (               n               = 9) was accompanied by a progressive increase in MBP+ myelin sheaths that were restricted to the periventricular white matter. The developmental window of high risk for PVL thus precedes the onset of myelination and identifies the late OL progenitor as the major potential target. Moreover, the decline in incidence of PVL at {$\sim$}32 weeks coincides with the onset of myelination in the periventricular white matter and suggests that the risk for PVL is related to the presence of late OL progenitors in the periventricular white matter.},

In this pre-registered meta-analysis, we reviewed 182 publications in infant (0-24 months) functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) research published from 1998 to April 9, 2020 and investigated the trends and predictors of attrition. The average attrition rate was 34.23\% among 272 experiments across all 182 publications. Among a subset of 136 experiments which reported the specific reasons of subject exclusion, 21.50\% of the attrition were infant-driven while 14.21\% were signal-driven. Subject characteristics (e.g., age) and study design (e.g., fNIRS cap configuration, block/trial design, and stimulus type) predicted the total and subject-driven attrition rates, suggesting that modifying the recruitment pool or the study design can meaningfully reduce the attrition rate in infant fNIRS research. Based on the findings, we established guidelines on reporting the attrition rate for scientific transparency and made recommendations to minimize the attrition rates. We also launched an attrition rate calculator (             LINK             ) to aid with research planning.

  abstract = {The brain can be parcellated into numerous anatomical and functional subunits. The classic work by Brodmann (Vergleichende Lokalisationslehre der Grosshirnrinde in ihren Prinzipien dargestellt auf Grund des Zellenbaues. Leipzig: Barth; 1909) identified areas of the cerebral cortex based on histological differences. An alternative to his cytoarchitectonic approach is the myeloarchitectonic approach. MRI has excellent white/gray matter contrast in the brain due to the presence of myelin, and thus seems uniquely suited for in vivo studies of cortical myeloarchitecture. Here it is demonstrated that the stripe or stria of Gennari can be consistently detected in human occipital cortex. T(1)-weighted images obtained at 3T from six of 10 normal volunteers, with resolutions of 350 x 350 x 600 mu clearly demonstrate this myelin-rich intracortical layer. It is concluded that the striate cortex (area 17 of Brodmann) of the human brain can be delineated in vivo on T(1)-weighted images, potentially enabling detection of specific cortical boundaries within individual brains.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) iron mapping including R2, R2* and magnetic susceptibility to differentiate patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) from healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty (30) healthy controls (HC) (64\textpm 7years old) and 20 patients with idiopathic PD (66\textpm 8years old) were studied using a 3T MR imaging scanner. R2 maps were generated from GRASE sequence while R2*, and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) were obtained from a conventional multi-echo gradient-echo sequence. R2, R2* and relative susceptibility ({$\Delta\chi$}) values of structures in the basal ganglia were measured for each patient and control. An analysis of sensitivity and specificity and unpaired t-test was applied to the two groups. RESULTS: A significant difference (p{$<$}0.05) was found for R2 and ∆{$\chi$} values in the substantia nigra as a whole and in the pars compacta for PD patients. The R2* values were different significantly (p{$<$}0.05) only on the substantia nigra pars compacta. QSM presented the highest sensitivity and specificity to differentiate the two populations. CONCLUSION: The QSM map was the most sensitive quantitative technique for detecting a significant increase of iron for PD. The highest significant difference between controls and patients was found in the substantia nigra pars compacta using QSM.},

DTI also furnishes scalar parameters that behave like quantitative histological or physiological 'stains' for different features of diffusion. These include Trace(D), which is related to the mean diffusivity, and a family of parameters derived from the diffusion tensor, D, which characterize different features of anisotropic diffusion. Simple thought experiments and geometrical constructs, such as the diffusion ellipsoid, can be used to understand water diffusion in isotropic and anisotropic media, and the NMR experiments used to characterize it.},

The brain, we argue, can be understood as a complex system or network, in which mental states emerge from the interaction between multiple physical and functional levels. Achieving further conceptual progress will crucially depend on broad-scale discussions regarding the properties of cognition and the tools that are currently available or must be developed in order to study mind-brain mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Background               There has been a recent proliferation in neuroimaging research focusing on brain development in the prenatal, neonatal and very early childhood brain. Early brain injury and preterm birth are associated with increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, indicating the importance of this early period for later outcome.                                         Scope and methodology               Although using a wide range of different methodologies and investigating diverse samples, the common aim of many of these studies has been to both track normative development and investigate deviations in this development to predict behavioural, cognitive and neurological function in childhood. Here we review structural and functional neuroimaging studies investigating the developing brain. We focus on practical and technical complexities of studying this early age range and discuss how neuroimaging techniques have been successfully applied to investigate later neurodevelopmental outcome.                                         Conclusions               Neuroimaging markers of later outcome still have surprisingly low predictive power and their specificity to individual neurodevelopmental disorders is still under question. However, the field is still young, and substantial challenges to both acquiring and modeling neonatal data are being met.                        ,                             Read the Commentary on this article at doi:               10.1111/jcpp.12890},

This review deals with the recent progress related to the origin and differentiation of the oligodendrocytes, their relationships to other neural cells, and functional neuroglial interactions under physiological conditions and in demyelinating diseases. One of the problems in studies of the CNS is to find components, i.e., markers, for the identification of the different cells, in intact tissues or cultures. In recent years, specific biochemical, immunological, and molecular markers have been identified. Many components specific to differentiating oligodendrocytes and to myelin are now available to aid their study. Transgenic mice and spontaneous mutants have led to a better understanding of the targets of specific dys- or demyelinating diseases. The best examples are the studies concerning the effects of the mutations affecting the most abundant protein in the central nervous myelin, the proteolipid protein, which lead to dysmyelinating diseases in animals and human (jimpy mutation and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease or spastic paraplegia, respectively). Oligodendrocytes, as astrocytes, are able to respond to changes in the cellular and extracellular environment, possibly in relation to a glial network. There is also a remarkable plasticity of the oligodendrocyte lineage, even in the adult with a certain potentiality for myelin repair after experimental demyelination or human diseases.},

AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the performance of very preterm, school-age children on three components of Executive Function (EF), two components of Executive Attention and a measure of IQ. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional, independent samples comparison. METHODS: A UK sample of 40 very preterm ({$<$}32 weeks gestational age, Mean 28.43, SD 2.41) children and 41 term born control children aged between 6 and 12 years (mean ages 8 years 5 months in both groups) was assessed on IQ, EF (inhibition, working memory and set shifting) and attention (sustained and selective). Between group comparisons were made using multivariate analysis of variance and covariance. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses indicated that preterm children scored significantly lower than their term born peers across Executive Function and executive attention tasks. As expected, the preterm group achieved IQ scores at the low end of the average range. Univariate analyses indicated some difficulties with shifting and inhibition components of EF, although covariate analysis revealed that only shifting was independent of IQ. CONCLUSIONS: Preterm children showed mild executive function and executive attention difficulties in the context of average IQ scores. The findings highlight the benefit of using multivariate assessments of executive skills rather than general intellectual outcome alone, to obtain a better distinction of the specific cognitive weaknesses associated with preterm birth.},

METHODS AND PROCEDURES: MTBI defined by International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD9-CM) codes for 'skull fracture', 'concussion', 'intracranial injury of unspecified nature' and 'head injury, unspecified'. MAIN OUTCOME AND RESULTS: The average incidence of mTBI was 503.1/100000, with peaks among males (590/100000), American Indians/Alaska Natives (1,026/100000) and those {$<$}5 years of age (1,115.2/100000). MTBI incidence was highest in the Midwest region (578.4/10000) and in non-urban areas (530.9/100000) of the US. Bicycles and sports accounted for 26.4\% of mTBI in the 5-14 age group. CONCLUSIONS: The national burden of mTBI is significant and the incidence higher than that reported by others. Possible explanations are discussed. Bicycle and sports-related injuries are an important and highly preventable cause of mTBI underscoring the need to promote prevention programmes on a national level.},

The purpose of this review is to characterize the relationship of nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of water diffusion and its anisotropy (i.e. directional dependence) with the underlying microstructure of neural fibres. The emphasis of the review will be on model neurological systems both in vitro and in vivo. A systematic discussion of the possible sources of anisotropy and their evaluation will be presented followed by an overview of various studies of restricted diffusion and compartmentation as they relate to anisotropy. Pertinent pathological models, developmental studies and theoretical analyses provide further insight into the basis of anisotropic diffusion and its potential utility in the nervous system.},

A similar degree of anisotropy of the average diffusion coefficients (DNMR) is observed for all three freshly excised nerve types (DNMR(parallel)/DNMR-(perpendicular) is 3.6 +/- 1.2, 3.2 +/- 0.9, and 2.6 +/- 0.4 for the olfactory, trigeminal, and optic nerves, respectively). The anisotropy of DNMR for the nonmyelinated olfactory nerve argues strongly that myelin is not a necessary determinant of diffusional anisotropy in ordered axonal systems (even though it may contribute when present). Garfish nerves treated with vinblastine, in order to depolymerize microtubules and inhibit fast axonal transport, also exhibit diffusional anisotropy (DNMR(parallel)/DNMR(perpendicular) is 2.6 +/- 0.4, 2.8 +/- 0.8, and 2.2 +/- 0.7 for the olfactory, trigeminal, and optic nerves, respectively) thus excluding a significant role for microtubules and fast axonal transport in that observed anisotropy.},

Most patients (18 of 19, 95\%) showed increased lesion volume over the first week and then decreased at 1 month relative to 1 week (12 of 14, 86\%). Overall, lesion growth appeared to depend on the degree of mismatch between diffusion and perfusion at the initial scan. Abnormal volumes on the acute DWI and PWI ({$<$}7 hours) correlated well with initial National Institutes of Health (NIH) stroke scale scores, outcome NIH stroke scale scores, and final lesion volume. DWI and PWI can provide an early measure of metabolic and hemodynamic insufficiency, and thus can improve our understanding of the evolution and outcome after acute ischemic stroke.},

Evolution is associated with clinical deterioration and is the reason for ICP monitoring or surgical intervention. We sought to define CT features that predict cerebral contusion evolution. METHODS: Patients treated for cerebral contusion who had 2 CT scans within 24 hours after injury were evaluated (n = 21). CT scans were analyzed for area of contusion, hemorrhagic components, and edema. Increase (\%) in contusion size was recorded. Contusion evolution was defined as {$>$} 5\% size increase. Ratios of hemorrhagic components to surrounding edema were calculated. RESULTS: Ten patients (47.6\%) showed contusion evolution and 11 (52.4\%) did not. Age, sex ratio, or injury severity between the 2 groups did not differ. Eight of 10 patients with evolving contusions had minimal or no perilesional edema on first CT; only 2 of 11 nonevolution patients had perilesional edema (p {$<$} 0.005). Mean ratio of area of surrounding edema to area of hemorrhagic products on first CT was 0.770 in evolution group versus 2.22 in non-evolution group (p = 0.055). CONCLUSIONS: A higher proportion of patients without contusion evolution had perilesional edema present on first CT scan. The absence of pericontusional edema on early CT may be a useful marker to predict contusion evolution.},

In order to avoid overfitting, we employ objective estimation of the amount of Gaussian noise through Bayesian analysis of the true dimensionality of the data, i.e., the number of activation and non-Gaussian noise sources. This enables us to carry out probabilistic modeling and achieves an asymptotically unique decomposition of the data. It reduces problems of interpretation, as each final independent component is now much more likely to be due to only one physical or physiological process. We also describe other improvements to standard ICA, such as temporal prewhitening and variance normalization of timeseries, the latter being particularly useful in the context of dimensionality reduction when weak activation is present. We discuss the use of prior information about the spatiotemporal nature of the source processes, and an alternative-hypothesis testing approach for inference, using Gaussian mixture models. The performance of our approach is illustrated and evaluated on real and artificial FMRI data, and compared to the spatio-temporal accuracy of results obtained from classical ICA and GLM analyses.},

Macroscopic measurements in cortical tissue demonstrated that electric conductivity (as well as permittivity) is frequency-dependent, while other measurements failed to evidence any dependence on frequency. In this article, we propose a model of the genesis of LFPs that accounts for the above data and contradictions. Starting from first principles (Maxwell equations), we introduce a macroscopic formalism in which macroscopic measurements are naturally incorporated, and also examine different physical causes for the frequency dependence. We suggest that ionic diffusion primes over electric field effects, and is responsible for the frequency dependence. This explains the contradictory observations, and also reproduces the 1/f power spectral structure of LFPs, as well as more complex frequency scaling. Finally, we suggest a measurement method to reveal the frequency dependence of current propagation in biological tissue, and which could be used to directly test the predictions of this formalism.},

This pulse sequence simultaneously acquires four different sets of images to provide the necessary information for volumetric analysis and reduces potential spatial misregistration of images due to patient motion. The image sets acquired from the proposed pulse sequence are 1) gray matter visible, 2) white matter visible, 3) FLAIR, and 4) fast spin-echo proton-density weighted images.

These changes in normal appearing WM (NAWM) are important with regard to the clinical picture and prognosis. However, the detection of changes within NAWM has so far required special imaging techniques commonly not available in clinical routine and, hence, at large scale. The purpose of this study was to detect MS-related damage of NAWM by conventional MRI. As, within NAWM, the myelin content mainly drives the T1-weighted (T1w) signal, we scaled it by the T2w signal. We tested the hypothesis that the mean T1w/T2w ratio of NAWM is decreased in MS compared to healthy controls (HC) and that it correlates with clinical measures. We developed a pipeline to determine the individual mean values of this ratio within NAWM. We studied 244 patients in early disease stages of MS (mean age 37~\textpm ~10~years, mean disease duration 3.1~\textpm ~2.3, Expanded Disability Status Scale 1.3~\textpm ~1), and 78 HC (mean age 31~\textpm ~8~years). Compared to HC, the mean T1w/T2w ratio was lowered in the patient group (P~{$<~$}0.001). The difference remained significant after restricting the analysis to patients with a disease duration of 5~years or less and without disease modifying drugs. Our measures also correlated with clinical scores. We believe that the mean T1w/T2w ratio is a promising candidate to assess MS-related tissue damage within NAWM at large scale.},

DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Outpatient neuropsychology service at a university-affiliated tertiary care center. PATIENTS: A consecutive sample of mild (n = 127) and moderate to severe (n = 75) patients with TBI and a general neurologic (non-TBI) group (n = 123) referred for neuropsychological assessment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient report of sleep and/or pain problems. RESULTS: TBI subjects had significantly more insomnia (56.4\% vs 30.9\%) and pain complaints (58.9\% vs 22\%) than non-TBI subjects (p {$<$} .0001). For both subject groups, the presence of pain increased insomnia approximately twofold. Poor sleep maintainance was the most common sleep problem. In those subjects without pain, TBI patients reported more sleep complaints that non-TBI patients (p = .05). Mild TBI patients reported significantly (p {$<$} .0001) more pain than patients with a moderate to severe injury (70\% vs 40\%). In TBI subjects without pain, there were significantly more insomnia complaints in mild than in moderate to severe injuries (p {$<$} .01). CONCLUSIONS: TBI patients with persistent cognitive complaints have more sleep and pain concerns than general neurologic patients. Pain is strongly associated with sleep problems. Aggressive evaluation and treatment of pain and sleep problems in the TBI, especially mild TBI, population appears warranted and may contribute to increased disability. The etiology of greater sleep and pain problems in the mild than in the more severe TBI patients requires further study.},

Previous work from our laboratory (Beggs and Plenz, 2003) revealed that propagation of local field potentials (LFPs) in cortical circuits could be described by the same equations that govern avalanches. Whereas modeling studies suggested that these ``neuronal avalanches'' were optimal for information transmission, it was not clear what role they could play in information storage. Work from numerous other laboratories has shown that cortical structures can generate reproducible spatiotemporal patterns of activity that could be used as a substrate for memory. Here, we show that although neuronal avalanches lasted only a few milliseconds, their spatiotemporal patterns were also stable and significantly repeatable even many hours later. To investigate these issues, we cultured coronal slices of rat cortex for 4 weeks on 60-channel microelectrode arrays and recorded spontaneous extracellular LFPs continuously for 10 hr. Using correlation-based clustering and a global contrast function, we found that each cortical culture spontaneously produced 4736 \textpm{} 2769 (mean \textpm{} SD) neuronal avalanches per hour that clustered into 30 \textpm{} 14 statistically significant families of spatiotemporal patterns. In 10 hr of recording, over 98\% of the mutual information shared by these avalanche patterns were retained. Additionally, jittering analysis revealed that the correlations between avalanches were temporally precise to within \textpm 4 msec. The long-term stability, diversity, and temporal precision of these avalanches indicate that they fulfill many of the requirements expected of a substrate for memory and suggest that they play a central role in both information transmission and storage within cortical networks.},

Recent work in physics has shown yet another mode of activity in systems composed of many nonlinear units interacting locally. For example, avalanches, earthquakes, and forest fires all propagate in systems organized into a critical state in which event sizes show no characteristic scale and are described by power laws. We hypothesized that a similar mode of activity with complex emergent properties could exist in networks of cortical neurons. We investigated this issue in mature organotypic cultures and acute slices of rat cortex by recording spontaneous local field potentials continuously using a 60 channel multielectrode array. Here, we show that propagation of spontaneous activity in cortical networks is described by equations that govern avalanches. As predicted by theory for a critical branching process, the propagation obeys a power law with an exponent of -3/2 for event sizes, with a branching parameter close to the critical value of 1. Simulations show that a branching parameter at this value optimizes information transmission in feedforward networks, while preventing runaway network excitation. Our findings suggest that ``neuronal avalanches'' may be a generic property of cortical networks, and represent a mode of activity that differs profoundly from oscillatory, synchronized, or wave-like network states. In the critical state, the network may satisfy the competing demands of information transmission and network stability.},

  abstract = {The significance of preterm birth lies in the complications of prematurity sustained by the infant and the impacts of these complications on the infant's survival and subsequent development. Many clinical research studies of infants born preterm limit their outcomes to neonatal mortality and morbidity. Complications and the disturbance of normal development may result from factors that influence prenatal development and the etiology of preterm birth, but the extent to which this happens is often unknown. Although this chapter is by no means a complete catalog of complications of preterm birth, this chapter discusses how these various complications reflect immaturity; the impact that they have on survival, organ maturation, and health; and the efficacies of a number of intervention strategies designed to prevent and mitigate the effects of these complications. As outlined in Chapter 2, information based on gestational age is preferred over information based on birth weight because of the value of knowledge of gestation age in making decisions regarding preterm delivery and prenatal counseling of the parent.},

  abstract = {There continues to be debate about the long-term neuropsychological impact of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). A meta-analysis of the relevant literature was conducted to determine the impact of MTBI across nine cognitive domains. The analysis was based on 39 studies involving 1463 cases of MTBI and 1191 control cases. The overall effect of MTBI on neuropsychological functioning was moderate (d = .54). However, findings were moderated by cognitive domain, time since injury, patient characteristics, and sampling methods. Acute effects (less than 3 months postinjury) of MTBI were greatest for delayed memory and fluency (d = 1.03 and .89, respectively). In unselected or prospective samples, the overall analysis revealed no residual neuropsychological impairment by 3 months postinjury (d = .04). In contrast, clinic-based samples and samples including participants in litigation were associated with greater cognitive sequelae of MTBI (d = .74 and .78, respectively at 3 months or greater). Indeed, litigation was associated with stable or worsening of cognitive functioning over time. The implications and limitations of these findings are discussed.},

The basis of this phenomenon is still under discussion, as many factors, such as iron concentration, myelination and tissue microstructure, could influence relaxation times. Furthermore, fiber direction in relation to the main magnetic field seems to influence T2* relaxation times. In this study, diffusion tensor imaging and T2* measurements were combined in seven subjects with the head in a normal and tilted position. It was shown that fiber orientation has a strong influence on T2* in the human brain, with the average T2* value changing from 49\,ms for a perpendicular orientation to B(0) to 57\,ms for a parallel orientation to B(0). Nevertheless, T2* times showed a wide variety of values at any orientation towards B(0).},

Cortical disconnection may thus contribute to the declines in some aspects of cognitive functioning observed in healthy aging. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is ideally suited for the study of cortical disconnection as it provides indices of structural integrity within interconnected neural networks. The current review summarizes results of previous DTI aging research with the aim of identifying consistent patterns of age-related differences in white matter integrity, and of relationships between measures of white matter integrity and behavioral performance as a function of adult age. We outline a number of future directions that will broaden our current understanding of these brain-behavior relationships in aging. Specifically, future research should aim to (1) investigate multiple models of age-brain-behavior relationships; (2) determine the tract-specificity versus global effect of aging on white matter integrity; (3) assess the relative contribution of normal variation in white matter integrity versus white matter lesions to age-related differences in cognition; (4) improve the definition of specific aspects of cognitive functioning related to age-related differences in white matter integrity using information processing tasks; and (5) combine multiple imaging modalities (e.g., resting-state and task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging; fMRI) with DTI to clarify the role of cerebral white matter integrity in cognitive aging.},

We explored initial postconcussion signs, symptoms, physical examination findings and time loss (i.e., time between the injury and medical clearance by the physician to return to competitive play), experienced by male professional ice-hockey players, and assessed the utility of initial postconcussion clinical manifestations in predicting time loss among hockey players. METHODS: We conducted a prospective case series of concussions over seven NHL regular seasons (1997-2004) using an inclusive cohort of players. The primary outcome was concussion and the secondary outcome was time loss. NHL team physicians documented post-concussion clinical manifestations and recorded the date when a player was medically cleared to return to play. RESULTS: Team physicians reported 559 concussions during regular season games. The estimated incidence was 1.8 concussions per 1000 player-hours. The most common postconcussion symptom was headache (71\%). On average, time loss (in days) increased 2.25 times (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.41-3.62) for every subsequent (i.e., recurrent) concussion sustained during the study period. Controlling for age and position, significant predictors of time loss were postconcussion headache (p {$<$} 0.001), low energy or fatigue (p = 0.01), amnesia (p = 0.02) and abnormal neurologic examination (p = 0.01). Using a previously suggested time loss cut-point of 10 days, headache (odds ratio [OR] 2.17, 95\% CI 1.33-3.54) and low energy or fatigue (OR 1.72, 95\% CI 1.04-2.85) were significant predictors of time loss of more than 10 days. INTERPRETATION: Postconcussion headache, low energy or fatigue, amnesia and abnormal neurologic examination were significant predictors of time loss among professional hockey players.},

  abstract = {Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a promising non-invasive method for obtaining information relating to the oxygen metabolism. However, the optimal acquisition sequence and QSM reconstruction method for reliable venous susceptibility measurements are unknown. Full flow compensation is generally recommended to correct for the influence of venous blood flow, although the effect of flow compensation on the accuracy of venous susceptibility values has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we investigated the effect of different acquisition sequences, including different flow compensation schemes, and different QSM reconstruction methods on venous susceptibilities. Ten healthy subjects were scanned with five or six distinct QSM sequence designs implementing different flow compensation schemes. All data sets were processed using six different QSM pipelines and venous blood susceptibility was evaluated in whole-brain segmentations of the venous vasculature and single veins. The quality of vein segmentations and the accuracy of venous susceptibility values were analyzed and compared between all combinations of sequences and QSM methods. The influence of the QSM method on average venous susceptibility values was found to be 2.7 - 11.6 times greater than the influence of the acquisition sequence, including flow compensation. The majority of the investigated QSM reconstruction methods tended to underestimate venous susceptibility values in the vein segmentations that were obtained. Using multi-echo gradient-echo acquisitions with monopolar readout gradients, we found that sequences without full flow compensation yielded venous susceptibility values comparable to sequences with full flow compensation. However, the QSM method had a great influence on susceptibility values and thus needs to be considered carefully for accurate venous QSM.},

We analyze how the type of dynamics (ordered or chaotic) exhibited by randomly connected networks of threshold gates driven by a time-varying input signal depends on the parameters describing the distribution of the connectivity matrix. In particular, we calculate the critical boundary in parameter space where the transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics takes place. Employing a recently developed framework for analyzing real-time computations, we show that only near the critical boundary can such networks perform complex computations on time series. Hence, this result strongly supports conjectures that dynamical systems that are capable of doing complex computational tasks should operate near the edge of chaos, that is, the transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics.},

  abstract = {Reductions in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals below baseline levels have been observed under several conditions as negative activation in task-activation studies or anticorrelation in resting-state experiments. Converging evidence suggests that negative BOLD signals (NBSs) can generally be explained by local reductions in neural activity. Here, we report on NBSs that accompany hemodynamic changes in regions devoid of neural tissue. The NBSs were investigated with high-resolution studies of the visual cortex (VC) at 7\,T. Task-activation studies were performed to localize a task-positive area in the VC. During rest, robust negative correlation with the task-positive region was observed in focal regions near the ventricles and dispersed throughout the VC. Both positive and NBSs were dependent on behavioral condition. Comparison with high-resolution structural images showed that negatively correlated regions overlapped with larger pial and ependymal veins near sulcal and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Results from multiecho fMRI showed that NBSs were consistent with increases in local blood volume. These findings confirm theoretical predictions that tie neural activity to blood volume increases, which tend to counteract positive fMRI signal changes associated with increased blood oxygenation. This effect may be more salient in high-resolution studies, in which positive and NBS may be more often spatially distinct.},

  abstract = {This article provides an overview of MRI methods exploiting magnetic susceptibility properties of blood to assess cerebral oxygen metabolism, including the tissue oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2). The first section is devoted to describing blood magnetic susceptibility and its effect on the MRI signal. Blood circulating in the vasculature can have diamagnetic (oxyhemoglobin) or paramagnetic properties (deoxyhemoglobin). The overall balance between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin determines the induced magnetic field which, in turn, modulates the transverse relaxation decay of the MRI signal via additional phase accumulation. The following sections of this review then illustrate the principles underpinning susceptibility-based techniques for quantifying OEF and CMRO2. Here, it is detailed whether these techniques provide global (OxFlow) or local (Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping - QSM, calibrated BOLD - cBOLD, quantitative BOLD - qBOLD, QSM+qBOLD) measurements of OEF or CMRO2, and what signal components (magnitude or phase) and tissue pools they consider (intravascular or extravascular). Validations studies and potential limitations of each method are also described. The latter include (but are not limited to) challenges in the experimental setup, the accuracy of signal modeling, and assumptions on the measured signal. The last section outlines the clinical uses of these techniques in healthy aging and neurodegenerative diseases and contextualizes these reports relative to results from gold-standard PET.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Focal cortical dysplasias (FCD) are localized regions of malformed cerebral cortex and are very frequently associated with epilepsy in both children and adults. A broad spectrum of histopathology has been included in the diagnosis of FCD. An ILAE task force proposes an international consensus classification system to better characterize specific clinicopathological FCD entities. METHODS: Thirty-two Task Force members have reevaluated available data on electroclinical presentation, imaging, neuropathological examination of surgical specimens as well as postsurgical outcome. KEY FINDINGS: The ILAE Task Force proposes a three-tiered classification system. FCD Type I refers to isolated lesions, which present either as radial (FCD Type Ia) or tangential (FCD Type Ib) dyslamination of the neocortex, microscopically identified in one or multiple lobes. FCD Type II is an isolated lesion characterized by cortical dyslamination and dysmorphic neurons without (Type IIa) or with balloon cells (Type IIb). Hence, the major change since a prior classification represents the introduction of FCD Type III, which occurs in combination with hippocampal sclerosis (FCD Type IIIa), or with epilepsy-associated tumors (FCD Type IIIb). FCD Type IIIc is found adjacent to vascular malformations, whereas FCD Type IIId can be diagnosed in association with epileptogenic lesions acquired in early life (i.e., traumatic injury, ischemic injury or encephalitis). SIGNIFICANCE: This three-tiered classification system will be an important basis to evaluate imaging, electroclinical features, and postsurgical seizure control as well as to explore underlying molecular pathomechanisms in FCD.},

NIRS and DOI offer the potential to quantify changes in deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) and total hemoglobin (HbT) concentration, thus enabling distinction of oxygen consumption and blood flow changes during brain activation. While the techniques implemented presently provide important results for cognition and the neurosciences through their relative measures of HbR and HbT concentrations, there is much to be done to improve sensitivity, accuracy, and resolution. In this paper, we review the advances currently being made and issues to consider for improving optical image quality. These include the optimal selection of wavelengths to minimize random and systematic error propagation in the calculation of the hemoglobin concentrations, the filtering of systemic physiological signal clutter to improve sensitivity to the hemodynamic response to brain activation, the implementation of overlapping measurements to improve image spatial resolution and uniformity, and the utilization of spatial prior information from structural and functional MRI to reduce DOI partial volume error and improve image quantitative accuracy.},

  abstract = {Myeloarchitecture, the pattern of myelin density across the cerebral cortex, has long been visualized in histological sections to identify distinct anatomical areas of the cortex. In humans, two-dimensional (2D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to visualize myeloarchitecture in select areas of the cortex, such as the stripe of Gennari in the primary visual cortex and Heschl's gyrus in the primary auditory cortex. Here, we investigated the use of MRI contrast based on longitudinal relaxation time (T(1)) to visualize myeloarchitecture in vivo over the entire cortex of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small non-human primate that is becoming increasingly important in neuroscience and neurobiology research. Using quantitative T(1) mapping, we found that T(1) at 7T in a cortical region with a high myelin content was 15\% shorter than T(1) in a region with a low myelin content. To maximize this T(1) contrast for imaging cortical myelination patterns, we optimized a magnetization-prepared rapidly acquired gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence. In whole-brain, 3D T(1)-weighted images made in vivo with the sequence, we identified six major cortical areas with high myelination and confirmed the results with histological sections stained for myelin. We also identified several subtle features of myeloarchitecture, showing the sensitivity of our technique. The ability to image myeloarchitecture over the entire cortex may prove useful in studies of longitudinal changes of the topography of the cortex associated with development and neuronal plasticity, as well as for guiding and confirming the location of functional measurements.},

  abstract = {We investigate information processing in randomly connected recurrent neural networks. It has been shown previously that the computational capabilities of these networks are maximized when the recurrent layer is close to the border between a stable and an unstable dynamics regime, the so called edge of chaos. The reasons, however, for this maximized performance are not completely understood. We adopt an information-theoretical framework and are for the first time able to quantify the computational capabilities between elements of these networks directly as they undergo the phase transition to chaos. Specifically, we present evidence that both information transfer and storage in the recurrent layer are maximized close to this phase transition, providing an explanation for why guiding the recurrent layer toward the edge of chaos is computationally useful. As a consequence, our study suggests self-organized ways of improving performance in recurrent neural networks, driven by input data. Moreover, the networks we study share important features with biological systems such as feedback connections and online computation on input streams. A key example is the cerebral cortex, which was shown to also operate close to the edge of chaos. Consequently, the behavior of model systems as studied here is likely to shed light on reasons why biological systems are tuned into this specific regime.},

METHODS:               Infants of gestational ages 22 to 29 weeks born between January 2006 and December 2016 at a Vermont Oxford Network center in the United States were studied. We examined mortality and morbidity rate differences and 95\% confidence intervals by sex and birth year. We tested temporal differences in mortality and morbidity rates between boys and girls by means of a likelihood ratio test (LRT) on nested binomial regression models with log links.                                         RESULTS:               A total of 205\,750 infants were studied; 97\,048 (47.2\%) infants were girls. The rate for mortality and chronic lung disease decreased over time faster for boys than for girls (LRT P \&lt; .001 for mortality; P = .006 for lung disease). Restricting to centers that remained throughout the entire study period did not change all the above but additionally revealed a significant year-sex interaction for respiratory distress syndrome, with a faster decline among boys (LRT P = .04). Morbidities, including patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, early-onset sepsis, late-onset sepsis, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, severe retinopathy of prematurity, and pneumothorax, revealed a constant rate difference between boys and girls over time.                                         CONCLUSIONS:               Compared with girls, male infants born at \&lt;30 weeks' gestation experienced faster declines in mortality, respiratory distress syndrome, and chronic lung disease over an 11-year period. Future research should investigate which causes of death declined among boys and whether their improved survival has been accompanied by a change in their neurodevelopmental impairment rate.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments on cortical neural networks have revealed the existence of well-defined avalanches of electrical activity. Such avalanches have been claimed to be generically scale invariant?i.e.?power law distributed?with many exciting implications in neuroscience. Recently, a self-organized model has been proposed by Levina, Herrmann and Geisel to explain this empirical finding. Given that (i) neural dynamics is dissipative and (ii) there is a loading mechanism progressively 'charging' the background synaptic strength, this model/dynamics is very similar in spirit to forest-fire and earthquake models, archetypical examples of non-conserving self-organization, which have recently been shown to lack true criticality. Here we show that cortical neural networks obeying (i) and (ii) are not generically critical; unless parameters are fine-tuned, their dynamics is either subcritical or supercritical, even if the pseudo-critical region is relatively broad. This conclusion seems to be in agreement with the most recent experimental observations. The main implication of our work is that, if future experimental research on cortical networks were to support the observation that truly critical avalanches are the norm and not the exception, then one should look for more elaborate (adaptive/evolutionary) explanations, beyond simple self-organization, to account for this.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides only limited insights into the nature of brain damage with modest clinic-radiological correlation. In this study, we applied recent advances in MRI techniques to study brain microstructural alterations in early relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients with minor deficits. Further, we investigated the potential use of advanced MRI to predict functional performances in these patients. METHODS: Brain relaxometry (T1, T2, T2*) and magnetization transfer MRI were performed at 3T in 36 RRMS patients and 18 healthy controls (HC). Multicontrast analysis was used to assess for microstructural alterations in normal-appearing (NA) tissue and lesions. A generalized linear model was computed to predict clinical performance in patients using multicontrast MRI data, conventional MRI measures as well as demographic and behavioral data as covariates. RESULTS: Quantitative T2 and T2* relaxometry were significantly increased in temporal normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) of patients compared to HC, indicating subtle microedema (P = 0.03 and 0.004). Furthermore, significant T1 and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) variations in lesions (mean T1 z-score: 4.42 and mean MTR z-score: -4.09) suggested substantial tissue loss. Combinations of multicontrast and conventional MRI data significantly predicted cognitive fatigue (P = 0.01, Adj-R (2) = 0.4), attention (P = 0.0005, Adj-R (2) = 0.6), and disability (P = 0.03, Adj-R (2) = 0.4). CONCLUSION: Advanced MRI techniques at 3T, unraveled the nature of brain tissue damage in early MS and substantially improved clinical-radiological correlations in patients with minor deficits, as compared to conventional measures of disease.},

Quantitative MCRI assessment of tissue water environments has provided new insights into the progression and underlying white matter pathology in neural disorders such as multiple sclerosis. It has not previously been applied to investigate changes in white matter in the stroke-affected brain. Thus, the purposes of this study were to 1) use MCRI to index myelin water content and tissue water environments in the brain after stroke 2) evaluate relationships between MWF and diffusion behavior indexed by diffusion tensor imaging-based metrics and 3) examine the relationship between white matter status (MWF and fractional anisotropy) and motor behavior in the chronic phase of stroke recovery. Twenty individuals with ischemic stroke and 12 matched healthy controls participated. Excellent to good test/re-test and inter-rater reliability was observed for region of interest-based voxelwise MWF data. Reduced MWF was observed in whole-cerebrum white matter (p~{$<~$}0.001) and in the ipsilesional (p~=~0.017) and contralesional (p~=~0.037) posterior limb of internal capsule (PLIC) after stroke compared to whole-cerebrum and bilateral PLIC MWF in healthy controls. The stroke group also demonstrated increased I/EWF, I/E GMT2 and global GMT2 times for whole-cerebrum white matter. Measures of diffusion behavior were also significantly different in the stroke group across each region investigated (p~{$<~$}0.001). MWF was not significantly correlated with specific tensor-based measures of diffusion in the PLIC for either group. Fractional anisotropy in the ipsilesional PLIC correlated with motor behavior in chronic stroke. These results provide novel insights into tissue-specific changes within white matter after stroke that may have important applications for the understanding of the neuropathology of stroke.},

Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity of                 GMA                 were 98\% (95\% confidence interval [                 CI                 ] 74--100\%) and 91\% (95\%                 CI                 83--93\%) respectively; of cranial ultrasound 74\% (95\%                 CI                 63--83\%) and 92\% (95\%                 CI                 81--96\%) respectively; and of neurological examination 88\% (95\%                 CI                 55--97\%) and 87\% (95\%                 CI                 57--97\%) respectively.                 MRI                 performed at term corrected age (in preterm infants) appeared to be a strong predictor of                 CP                 , with sensitivity ranging in individual studies from 86 to 100\% and specificity ranging from 89 to 97\% There was inadequate evidence for the use of other predictive tools.                                                        Summary                                This review found that the assessment with the best evidence and strength for predictive accuracy is the                 GMA                 . MRI has a good predictive value when performed at term-corrected age. Cranial ultrasound is as specific as                 MRI                 and has the advantage of being readily available at the bedside. Studies to date have focused on high-risk infants. The accuracy of these tests in low-risk infants remains unclear and requires further research.                                       ,                             This article is commented on by Hanna on pages               397--398               of this issue.},

The strength of SWI lies not just in its ability to identify hemorrhage, calcium or nonheme iron by virtue of its susceptibility artifact, but also more importantly, the blood oxygen level dependent venography principle whereby several diseases can be diagnosed earlier. We are continuing to harness the power of SWI in the field of pediatric neuroimaging. In this paper, we will make a comprehensive review and discuss the utility of SWI in pediatric neuroimaging in establishing the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and also understanding the pathomechanism of various pediatric brain pathologies.},

  abstract = {The kinetics of synaptogenesis in the primary visual cortex (Brodmann's area 17) were analyzed by electron microscopy in 33 rhesus monkeys, ranging in age from the 50th embryonic day (E50) to 20 years. A series of overlapping electron micrographs (vertical probes) were examined at each age on sections of the upper bank of the calcarine fissure. Synaptic contacts were first observed in the E50 specimen in the subplate and marginal zone (prospective layer I). In the cortical plate itself, synapses appear between E65 and E89 starting in the prospective layer VI. By E112, after all cortical neurons have assumed their laminar positions, synapses situated predominantly on dendritic shafts were present at a low density throughout the full thickness of the cortical plate. Thereafter, synapses accumulate more rapidly on dendritic spines and by E144 an equal number of contacts are found on both spines and shafts. The density of synapses continues to increase exponentially in all layers and reaches the mean maximum density of about 90 synapses per 100 microns 3 of neuropil by the third postnatal month. During the next 2 postnatal years the density of synaptic contacts decreases only slightly to a mean of 80/100 microns 3 of neuropil. Around the time of puberty, however, synaptic density decreases more rapidly to reach the adult level of about 40--50/100 microns 3 of neuropil. The 40\% decrease in the density of synaptic contacts occurring between 2.7 and 5 years represents a loss of about 5000 synapses per second in the primary visual cortex of the two hemispheres, due primarily to the loss of asymmetric synapses situated on dendritic spines. The transient phase of high density of synaptic contacts located on dendrospines is shorter in thalamo-recipient layer IV than in either supra- or intragranular layers and is completed within the first postnatal year. It ends earlier in sublayer IVC than in layers IVAB and II-III, for example, reflecting biochemical and functional maturation of the different visual subsystems.},

Therefore, this study investigated the association between PA and white matter microstructure of pathways connecting to the hippocampus. A total of 33 young, healthy adults underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). High angular resolution diffusion-weighted imaging and multi-component relaxometry MRI scans (multi-component driven equilibrium pulse observation of T1 and T2) were acquired for each participant. Activity levels (AL) of participants were calculated from 72-h actigraphy recordings. Tractography using the damped Richardson Lucy algorithm was used to reconstruct the fornix and bilateral parahippocampal cinguli (PHC). The mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and the myelin water fraction (MWF), a putative marker of myelination, were determined for each pathway. A positive correlation between both AL and FA and between AL and MWF were hypothesized for the three pathways. There was a selective positive correlation between AL and MWF in the right PHC (r~=~0.482, p~=~0.007). Thus, our results provide initial in vivo evidence for an association between myelination of the right PHC and PA in young healthy adults. Our results suggest that MWF may not only be more specific, but also more sensitive than FA to detect white matter microstructural alterations. If PA was to induce structural plasticity of the right PHC this may contribute to reverse structural alterations of the right PHC in neuropsychiatric disorder with hippocampal pathologies.},

Thirty-six patients were studied 1 week and 1 year after a traumatic brain injury. A similar MRI technique was used in both studies; T2-weighted fast or turbo spin echo images, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images and T1-weighted images were used for analysis. The number and extent of contusions and semi-quantitative score of other traumatic intraparenchymal lesions were compared in the early and late phase. Contusions were seen in 18 patients both in acute and 1 year MRI; the number and extent of visible contusions was significantly decreased at 1 year. Other traumatic intraparenchymal lesions were detected in 12 patients in early MRI and in 10 patients in late MRI. The number of visible lesions and the semi-quantitative scores were significantly lower at 1 year. There is a significant decrease in the visibility of both cortical contusions and other intraparenchymal injuries in late MRI studies compared with studies in acute stage using conventional imaging techniques. Thus, early phase MRI is essential for the detection of brain injury at least using conventional imaging techniques.},

OBJECTIVE: To confirm the established correlation between hippocampal volumes and neuron cell counts, and to study the still controversial association between signal change and gliosis. METHODS: The authors studied 44 patients (22 men and 22 women; mean age at surgery, 37 years) with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. Quantitative assessment of hippocampal volumes and T2 relaxometry, and neuron and glial cell count in the region CA1 and molecular layer of the dentate gyrus was performed. The proportion of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive glial cells (reactive astrocytes) was indicated. RESULTS: In a stepwise regression, the ipsilateral hippocampal volume was predicted best by the neuron cell count in the dentate gyrus (p = 0.005, r = 0.4). Hippocampal T2 time, however, was predicted best by the glial cell count in the dentate gyrus (p = 0.01, r = 0.4). None of the other cell counts contributed to either model. In the dentate, 31\% of the glial cells were reactive astrocytes, whereas in CA1, 5\% were reactive. CONCLUSION: The results confirmed the correlation between hippocampal volumes and neuron cell counts. T2-weighted signal increase in the hippocampus was mainly influenced by gliosis in the dentate gyrus, where a high proportion of glial cells show abnormal activity. This activity may reflect changes important in the development of hippocampal epileptogenicity.},

Consistent with this notion, excitation-inhibition imbalances are considered a pathophysiological mechanism in many brain disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, methods to measure E/I ratios in human brain networks are lacking. Here, we present a method to quantify a functional E/I ratio (               fE               /               I               ) from neuronal oscillations, and validate it in healthy subjects and children with ASD. We define structural E/I ratio in an               in silico               neuronal network, investigate how it relates to power and long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) of the network's activity, and use these relationships to design the               fE               /               I               algorithm. Application of this algorithm to the EEGs of healthy adults showed that               fE               /               I               is balanced at the population level and is decreased through GABAergic enforcement. In children with ASD, we observed larger               fE               /               I               variability and stronger LRTC compared to typically developing children (TDC). Interestingly, visual grading for EEG abnormalities that are thought to reflect E/I imbalances revealed elevated               fE               /               I               and LRTC in ASD children with normal EEG compared to TDC or ASD with abnormal EEG. We speculate that our approach will help understand physiological heterogeneity also in other brain disorders.},

Of these 70 publications, 33 presented quantitatively validated results. There is still no consensus on which targeting technique to use for surgery planning; methods vary greatly between centers. Some groups apply indirect methods involving anatomical landmarks, or atlases incorporating anatomical or functional data. Others perform direct visualization on MR imaging, using T2-weighted spin echo or inversion recovery protocols. The combined studies do not offer a straightforward conclusion on the best targeting protocol. Indirect methods are not patient specific, leading to varying results between cases. On the other hand, direct targeting on MR imaging suffers from lack of contrast within the subthalamic region, resulting in a poor delineation of the STN. These deficiencies result in a need for intraoperative adaptation of the original target based on test stimulation with or without microelectrode recording. It is expected that future advances in MR imaging technology will lead to improvements in direct targeting. The use of new MR imaging modalities such as diffusion MR imaging might even lead to the specific identification of the different functional parts of the STN, such as the dorsolateral sensorimotor part, the target for deep brain stimulation.},

  abstract = {Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a means to obtain direct measurements of local tissue susceptibility distribution. Usually the focus is on imaging tissues in the brain, and the region of the brain studied is dictated by an eroded skull stripped mask. Producing the pristine local phase behavior for regions at the edge of the brain has been difficult in the past. For structures such as the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) that run alongside the surface of the brain and under the skull bones, a considerable part of the external phase from the dipole effect is lost due to the short T2* of the bones. In this paper, we propose a method that seeks to reconstruct the susceptibility distribution inside the dural sinuses by ensuring that the entire geometry of the dural sinuses is preserved with the help of an MR angiogram and venogram (MRAV). Having a geometrical model of the vessels makes it possible to estimate the missing phase outside the brain as well, by using the forward phase model and, hence, allowing a complete phase map to be reconstructed. Fifteen healthy volunteers were scanned using a susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) sequence with interleaved rephaseddephased echoes. QSM results were compared between the conventional techniques and the proposed method of phase preservation outside the brain and inside the dural sinuses. This method demonstrates the reconstruction of the SSS, whereas conventional methods are either unable to preserve this structure or unable to provide complete phase information. The mean and standard deviation inside the SSS for all volunteers was 435 \textpm{} 5 ppb (this is the inter-subject error). To validate the proposed approach, the mean susceptibility inside the straight sinus showed good agreement between conventional approach and the proposed method. The results presented in this study indicate the potential of generating the susceptibility map for the whole brain, including the SSS (as well as potentially all the cortical veins).},

In contusion SC injury (SCI), a decrease in lambda( parallel) matched the pattern of axonal damage with high accuracy, but lambda( perpendicular) did not match the pattern of demyelination detected by LFB. In a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS), lambda( perpendicular) and lambda( parallel) did not match the patterns of demyelination or axonal damage, respectively. However, a region of interest (ROI) analysis suggested that lambda( perpendicular)-detected demyelination paralleled that observed with LFB, and lambda( parallel) decreased in both regions of axonal damage and normal-appearing WM (NAWM) as visualized by SMI-31. The results suggest that directional diffusivities may reveal abnormalities that are not obvious with SMI-31 and LFB staining, depending on the type of injury.},

Here, these three contrast mechanisms are examined at a field strength of 9.4 T. The T(2) * maps generated allow the identification of white matter structures not visible in conventional images. Phase images with in-plane resolutions down to 130 {$\mu$}m were obtained, showing high gray/white matter contrast and allowing the identification of internal cortical structures.

While classic theories suggest that traumatically injured axons are mechanically torn at the moment of injury, studies in the last two decades have not supported this premise in the majority of injured axons. Rather, current thought considers TAI a progressive process evoked by the tensile forces of injury, gradually evolving from focal axonal alteration to ultimate disconnection. Recent observations have demonstrated that traumatically induced focal axolemmal permeability leads to local influx of Ca2+ with the subsequent activation of the cysteine proteases, calpain and caspase, that then play a pivotal role in the ensuing pathogenesis of TAI via proteolytic digestion of brain spectrin, a major constituent of the subaxolemmal cytoskeletal network, the "membrane skeleton". In this pathological progression this local Ca2+ overloading with the activation of calpains also initiates mitochondrial injury that results in the release of cytochrome-c, with the activation of caspase. Both the activated calpain and caspases then participate in the degradation of the local axonal cytoskeleton causing local axonal failure and disconnection. In this review, we summarize contemporary thought on the pathogenesis of TAI, while discussing the potential diversity of pathological processes observed within various injured fiber types. The anterograde and retrograde consequences of TAI are also considered together with a discussion of various experimental therapeutic approaches capable of attenuating TAI.},

  abstract = {Even in the absence of an experimental effect, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series generally demonstrate serial dependence. This colored noise or endogenous autocorrelation typically has disproportionate spectral power at low frequencies, i.e., its spectrum is (1/f)-like. Various pre-whitening and pre-coloring strategies have been proposed to make valid inference on standardised test statistics estimated by time series regression in this context of residually autocorrelated errors. Here we introduce a new method based on random permutation after orthogonal transformation of the observed time series to the wavelet domain. This scheme exploits the general whitening or decorrelating property of the discrete wavelet transform and is implemented using a Daubechies wavelet with four vanishing moments to ensure exchangeability of wavelet coefficients within each scale of decomposition. For (1/f)-like or fractal noises, e.g., realisations of fractional Brownian motion (fBm) parameterised by Hurst exponent 0 {$<$} H {$<$} 1, this resampling algorithm exactly preserves wavelet-based estimates of the second order stochastic properties of the (possibly nonstationary) time series. Performance of the method is assessed empirically using (1/f)-like noise simulated by multiple physical relaxation processes, and experimental fMRI data. Nominal type 1 error control in brain activation mapping is demonstrated by analysis of 13 images acquired under null or resting conditions. Compared to autoregressive pre-whitening methods for computational inference, a key advantage of wavelet resampling seems to be its robustness in activation mapping of experimental fMRI data acquired at 3 Tesla field strength. We conclude that wavelet resampling may be a generally useful method for inference on naturally complex time series.},

A method for fractal analysis that describes 100 SEEG data points in terms of a single estimate of fractal dimension (1 {$<$} FD {$<$} 2) is reported; the central processing unit time costs amount to approximately 2 min/Mbyte of input signal (using a Sun SPARCstation LX). The diagnostic sensitivity of this method, applied to quantification and synoptic visualisation of SEEG signals recorded during 35 epileptic seizures in 7 patients, is evaluated. It is found that the method consistently defines ictal onset in terms of rapid relative increase in FD across several channels. Clinically severe seizures are characterised by more intense and generalised ictal changes in FD than clinically less severe events. For all 7 patients, and for 75\% of individual seizures, "fractal diagnoses" of anatomically defined ictal onset zone coincided closely with ictal onset zone independently determined by inspection of traditional EEG displays of the same data. We conclude that the method is a computationally feasible way to achieve substantial reduction in the volume of SEEG data without undue loss of diagnostically important information in the primary signal.},

This book provides eloquent support for the idea that spontaneous neuron activity, far from being mere noise, is actually the source of our cognitive abilities. It takes a fresh look at the coevolution of structure and function in the mammalian brain, illustrating how self-emerged oscillatory timing is the brain's fundamental organizer of neuronal information. The small-world-like connectivity of the cerebral cortex allows for global computation on multiple spatial and temporal scales. The perpetual interactions among the multiple network oscillators keep cortical systems in a highly sensitive "metastable" state and provide energy-efficient synchronizing mechanisms via weak links. In a sequence of "cycles," Gy\"orgy Buzs\'aki guides the reader from the physics of oscillations through neuronal assembly organization to complex cognitive processing and memory storage. His clear, fluid writing-accessible to any reader with some scientific knowledge-is supplemented by extensive footnotes and references that make it just as gratifying and instructive a read for the specialist. The coherent view of a single author who has been at the forefront of research in this exciting field, this volume is essential reading for anyone interested in our rapidly evolving understanding of the brain.},

  abstract = {The electrophysiological responses of the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to stimulated synaptic input from the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) were investigated using a hypothalamic slice preparation that includes the entire SCN, optic chiasm and optic nerves. Extracellular recordings of single-unit activity reveal a population of neurons in the ventrolateral SCN that are activated at a median latency of 10 ms after stimulation of the contralateral optic nerve. These neurons apparently receive direct excitatory input from RHT synapses. Other SCN neurons are activated at longer latencies, possibly through input from interneurons. The population field potentials evoked in the SCN by optic nerve volleys consist of a calcium-insensitive transient generated by optic tract axons in the chiasm, followed by calcium-sensitive waves generated by postsynaptic activity. The postsynaptic waves have the form of a field EPSP, negative in the dorsolateral SCN and positive in the ventrolateral SCN, upon which is superimposed a population spike of opposite polarity. The population spike occurs at the same latency as the monosynaptic single unit responses, which were all found near or ventral to the point of reversal of field potential. These findings suggest that neurons in the ventrolateral SCN are excited by synapses on dorsally extended dendrites. The conduction velocity of the RHT in the optic nerve was found to be 0.59 +/- 0.03 mm/ms, while that of the optic tract volley was 2.4 +/- 0.75 mm/ms. The low conduction velocity of the RHT indicates that, within the optic nerve, these axons are thin and/or unmyelinated in the optic nerve.},

  abstract = {Background: Temporal fractals are characterized by prominent scale-invariance and self-similarity across time scales. Monofractal analysis quantifies this scaling behavior in a single parameter, the Hurst exponent (H). Higher H reflects greater correlation in the signal structure, which is taken as being more fractal. Previous fMRI studies have observed lower H during conventional tasks relative to resting state conditions, and shown that H is negatively correlated with task difficulty and novelty. To date, no study has investigated the fractal dynamics of BOLD signal during naturalistic conditions. Methods: We performed fractal analysis on Human Connectome Project 7T fMRI data (n = 72, 41 females, mean age 29.46 \textpm{} 3.76 years) to compare H across movie-watching and rest. Results: In contrast to previous work using conventional tasks, we found higher H values for movie relative to rest (mean difference = 0.014; p = 5.279 \texttimes{} 10-7; 95\% CI [0.009, 0.019]). H was significantly higher in movie than rest in the visual, somatomotor and dorsal attention networks, but was significantly lower during movie in the frontoparietal and default networks. We found no cross-condition differences in test-retest reliability of H. Finally, we found that H of movie-derived stimulus properties (e.g., luminance changes) were fractal whereas H of head motion estimates were non-fractal. Conclusions: Overall, our findings suggest that movie-watching induces fractal signal dynamics. In line with recent work characterizing connectivity-based brain state dynamics during movie-watching, we speculate that these fractal dynamics reflect the configuring and reconfiguring of brain states that occurs during naturalistic processing, and are markedly different than dynamics observed during conventional tasks.},

Like natural phenomena such as the growth of a tree or crashing ocean waves, the brain expresses scale-invariant, or fractal, patterns in neural signals that can be measured. While neural phenomena may represent both monofractal and multifractal processes and can be quantified with many different interrelated parameters, this review will focus on monofractal analysis using the Hurst exponent (H). Monofractal analysis of fMRI data is an advanced analysis technique that measures the complexity of brain signaling by quantifying its degree of scale-invariance. As such, the H value of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal specifies how the degree of correlation in the signal may mediate brain functions. This review presents a brief overview of the theory of fMRI monofractal analysis followed by notable findings in the field. Through highlighting the advantages and challenges of the technique, the article provides insight into how to best conduct fMRI fractal analysis and properly interpret the findings with physiological relevance. Furthermore, we identify the future directions necessary for its progression towards impactful functional neuroscience discoveries and widespread clinical use. Ultimately, this presenting review aims to build a foundation of knowledge among readers to facilitate greater understanding, discussion, and use of this unique yet powerful imaging analysis technique.},

Especially before 32\,weeks of gestation, infants may require respiratory support, but at the same time, ventilation is known to induce oxidative stress, increasing the risk of brain injury. Ventilation may cause brain damage through two pathways: localized cerebral inflammatory response and hemodynamic instability. During ventilation, the most important causes of pro-inflammatory cytokine release are oxygen toxicity, barotrauma and volutrauma. The purpose of this review was to analyze the mechanism of ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) and the relationship between brain injury and VILI in order to provide the safest possible respiratory support to a premature baby. As gentle ventilation from the delivery room is needed to reduce VILI, it is recommended to start ventilation with 21--30\% oxygen, prefer a non-invasive respiratory approach and, if mechanical ventilation is required, prefer low Positive End-Expiratory Pressure and tidal volume.},

  abstract = {Entropy is a dimensionless quantity that is used for measuring uncertainty about the state of a system but it can also imply physical qualities, where high entropy is synonymous with high disorder. Entropy is applied here in the context of states of consciousness and their associated neural dynamics, with a particular focus on the psychedelic state. The psychedelic state is considered an exemplar of a primitive or primary state of consciousness that preceded the development of modern, adult, human, normal waking consciousness. Based on neuroimaging data with psilocybin, a classic psychedelic drug, it is argued that the defining feature of `primary states' is elevated entropy in certain aspects of brain function, such as the repertoire of functional connectivity motifs that form and fragment across time. It is noted that elevated entropy in this sense, is a characteristic of systems exhibiting `self-organised criticality', i.e., a property of systems that gravitate towards a `critical' point in a transition zone between order and disorder in which certain phenomena such as power-law scaling appear. This implies that entropy is suppressed in normal waking consciousness, meaning that the brain operates just below criticality. It is argued that this entropy suppression furnishes consciousness with a constrained quality and associated metacognitive functions, including reality-testing and self-awareness. It is also proposed that entry into primary states depends on a collapse of the normally highly organised activity within the default-mode network (DMN) and a decoupling between the DMN and the medial temporal lobes (which are normally significantly coupled). These hypotheses can be tested by examining brain activity and associated cognition in other candidate primary states such as REM sleep and early psychosis and comparing these with non-primary states such as normal waking consciousness and the anaesthetised state.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modality sensitive to deoxyhemoglobin, is a promising method for measuring cerebral oxygenation in human neonates. Paramagnetic sources, like deoxyhemoglobin, however, can be obscured by diamagnetic sources such as water and myelin. This study evaluated whether QSM images, or isolated paramagnetic components, are more accurate for measuring oxygenation of cerebral veins of preterm neonates, and explored oxygenation differences between the major cerebral veins.                                         Methods                                19 preterm neonates were scanned on at term equivalent age on a 3T MRI using a multi-echo susceptibility-weighted imaging sequence. Susceptibility values were calculated from QSM images to determine oxygen saturation (SvO                 2                 ) in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and central cerebral veins (CCV). The paramagnetic components of QSM images were isolated, and SvO                 2                 values were recalculated.                                                        Results                                The mean SvO                 2                 values from QSM were 72.4\% (SD, 3.4\%) for the SSS and 68.7\% (SD, 3.5\%) for the CCV. SvO                 2                 values for paramagnetic components were 58.1\% (SD, 7.3\%) for the SSS and 57.7\% (SD, 7.0\%) for the CCV.                                                        Conclusion               While paramagnetic component decomposition yielded SSS values closer to those found in the literature, it increased variability. No significant oxygenation differences were found between the SSS and CCV, contrasting with prior studies.                                         Impact                                                                        This study evaluated the use of QSM and its paramagnetic components to measure cerebral oxygenation in neonates.                                                                                  By comparing susceptibility-derived oxygen saturation (SvO                       2                       ) in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and central cerebral veins (CCV), it adds to the field of neonatal cerebral oxygenation measurement.                                                                                                       Decomposing QSM into paramagnetic components shows potential for improving SvO                       2                       accuracy, particularly in the SSS, though variability remains a challenge.                                                                                The results suggest no significant oxygenation difference between the SSS and CCV, contrasting with previous findings, indicating a need for further research on neonatal venous oxygenation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the knowledge and use of recommendations for the management of sport-related concussion (SRC) among sport and exercise medicine physicians (SEMPs) and emergency department physicians (EDPs) to assess the success of SRC knowledge transfer across Canada. DESIGN: A self-administered, multiple-choice survey accessed via e-mail by SEMPs and EDPs. The survey had been assessed for content validity. SETTING: Canada. PARTICIPANTS: The survey was completed between May and July 2012 by SEMPs who had passed the diploma examination of the Canadian Academy of Sport and Exercise Medicine and by EDPs who did not hold this diploma. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Knowledge and identification of sources of concussion management information, use of concussion diagnosis strategies, and whether physicians use common and consistent terminology when explaining cognitive rest strategies to patients after an SRC. RESULTS: There was a response rate of 28\% (305 of 1085). The SEMP and EDP response rates were 41\% (147 of 360) and 22\% (158 of 725), respectively. Of the responses, 41\% of EDPs and 3\% of SEMPs were unaware of any consensus statements on concussion in sport; 74\% of SEMPs used the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, version 2 (SCAT2), "usually or always," whereas 88\% of EDPs never used the SCAT2. When queried about how cognitive rest could best be achieved after an SRC, no consistent answer was documented. CONCLUSION: Differences and a lack of consistency in the implementation of recommendations for SRC patients were identified for SEMPs and EDPs. It appears that the SCAT2 is used more in the SEMP setting than in the emergency context. Further knowledge transfer efforts and research should address the barriers to achieving more consistent advice given by physicians who attend SRC patients.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine how preterm white matter injury (WMI) and long-term thalamic growth interact to predict 8-year neurodevelopmental outcomes. METHODS: A prospective cohort of 114 children born at 24 to 32\,weeks' gestational age (GA) underwent structural and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging early in life (median 32\,weeks), at term-equivalent age and at 8\,years. Manual segmentation of neonatal WMI was performed on T1-weighted images and thalamic volumes were obtained using the MAGeT brain segmentation pipeline. Cognitive, motor, and visual-motor outcomes were evaluated at 8\,years of age. Multivariable regression was used to examine the relationship among neonatal WMI volume, school-age thalamic volume, and neurodevelopmental outcomes. RESULTS: School-age thalamic volumes were predicted by neonatal thalamic growth rate, GA, sex, and neonatal WMI volume (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). After accounting for total cerebral volume, WMI volume remained associated with school-age thalamic volume ({$\beta~$}=~-0.31, p~=~0.005). In thalamocortical tracts, fractional anisotropy (FA) at term-equivalent age interacted with early WMI volume to predict school-age thalamic volumes (all p\,{$<$}\,0.02). School-age thalamic volumes and neonatal WMI interacted to predict full-scale IQ (p~=~0.002) and adverse motor scores among those with significant WMI (p~=~0.01). Visual-motor scores were predicted by thalamic volumes (p~=~0.04). INTERPRETATION: In very preterm-born children, neonatal thalamic growth and WMI volume predict school-age thalamic volumes. The emergence at term of an interaction between FA and WMI to impact school-age thalamic volume indicates dysmaturation as a mechanism of thalamic growth failure. Cognition is predicted by the interaction of WMI and thalamic growth, highlighting the need to consider multiple dimensions of brain injury in these children. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:584-594.},

  abstract = {The process of axonal and dendritic development establishes the synaptic circuitry of the central nervous system (CNS) and is the result of interactions between intrinsic molecular factors and the external environment. One growth factor that has a compelling function in neuronal development is the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF participates in axonal and dendritic differentiation during embryonic stages of neuronal development, as well as in the formation and maturation of dendritic spines during postnatal development. Recent studies have also implicated vesicular trafficking of BDNF via secretory vesicles, and both secretory and endosomal trafficking of vesicles containing synaptic proteins, such as neurotransmitter and neurotrophin receptors, in the regulation of axonal and dendritic differentiation, and in dendritic spine morphogenesis. Several genes that are either mutated or deregulated in neurodevelopmental disorders associated with mental retardation have now been identified, and several mouse models of these disorders have been generated and characterized. Interestingly, abnormalities in dendritic and synaptic structure are consistently observed in human neurodevelopmental disorders associated with mental retardation, and in mouse models of these disorders as well. Abnormalities in dendritic and synaptic differentiation are thought to underlie altered synaptic function and network connectivity, thus contributing to the clinical outcome. Here, we review the roles of BDNF and vesicular trafficking in axonal and dendritic differentiation in the context of dendritic and axonal morphological impairments commonly observed in neurodevelopmental disorders associated with mental retardation.},

  abstract = {The effects of e-cigarette (e-cig) aerosol inhalation by nonsmokers have not been examined to date. The present study was designed to evaluate the acute response to aerosol inhalation of non-nicotinized e-cigarettes in terms of oxidative stress and indices of endothelial activation in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVEC). Ten smoking-na\"ive healthy subjects (mean age\,\textpm\,SD =\,28.7\,\textpm\,5.5 yr) were subjected to an e-cig challenge, following which their serum was monitored for markers of inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM)] and nitric oxide metabolites (NOx). The oxidative stress and inflammation burden of the circulating serum on the vascular network was also assessed by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and induction of ICAM-1 expression on HPMVEC. Our results show that serum indices of oxidative stress and inflammation increased significantly (P {$<$} 0.05 as compared with baseline), reaching a peak at approximately 1-2 h post-e-cig aerosol inhalation and returning to baseline levels at 6 h. The circulatory burden of the serum (ICAM-1 and ROS) increased significantly at 2 h and returned to baseline values 6 h post-e-cig challenge. ROS production by HPMVEC was found to occur via activation of the NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) pathways. These findings suggest that even in the absence of nicotine, acute e-cig aerosol inhalation leads to a transient increase in oxidative stress and inflammation. This can adversely affect the vascular endothelial network by promoting oxidative stress and immune cell adhesion. Thus e-cig inhalation has the potential to drive the onset of vascular pathologies.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the association of early brain maturation with neurodevelopmental outcome in premature neonates. METHODS: Neonates born between 24 and 32 weeks' gestation (April 2006 to August 2010) were prospectively studied with MRI early in life and again at term-equivalent age. Using diffusion tensor imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, fractional anisotropy (FA) (microstructure) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/choline (metabolism) were measured from the basal nuclei, white matter tracts, and superior white matter. Brain maturation is characterized by increasing FA and NAA/choline from early in life to term-equivalent age. In premature neonates, systemic illness and critical care therapies have been linked to abnormalities of these measures. Of the 177 neonates in this cohort, 5 died and 157 (91\% of survivors) were assessed at 18 months' corrected age (adjusted for prematurity) using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III motor, cognitive, and language composite scores (mean = 100, SD = 15). RESULTS: Among these 157 infants, white matter injury was seen in 48 (30\%). Severe white matter injury, in 10 neonates (6\%), was associated with a decrease in motor (-18 points; p {$<$} 0.001) and cognitive (-8 points; p = 0.085) scores. With greater severity of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, slower increases in FA and NAA/choline were observed in the basal nuclei and brain white matter regions as neonates matured to term-equivalent age, independent of the presence of white matter injury. CONCLUSIONS: In the preterm neonate, abnormal brain maturation evolves through the period of neonatal intensive care and is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.},

  abstract = {Iron is a key nutrient for normal central nervous system (CNS) development and function; thus, iron deficiency as well as iron excess may result in harmful effects in the CNS. Oligodendrocytes and astrocytes are crucial players in brain iron equilibrium. However, the mechanisms of iron uptake, storage, and efflux in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes during CNS development or under pathological situations such as demyelination are not completely understood. In the CNS, iron is directly required for myelin production as a cofactor for enzymes involved in ATP, cholesterol and lipid synthesis, and oligodendrocytes are the cells with the highest iron levels in the brain which is linked to their elevated metabolic needs associated with the process of myelination. Unlike oligodendrocytes, astrocytes do not have a high metabolic requirement for iron. However, these cells are in close contact with blood vessel and have a strong iron transport capacity. In several pathological situations, changes in iron homoeostasis result in altered cellular iron distribution and accumulation and oxidative stress. In inflammatory demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, reactive astrocytes accumulate iron and upregulate iron efflux and influx molecules, which suggest that they are outfitted to take up and safely recycle iron. In this review, we will discuss the participation of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in CNS iron homeostasis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of iron uptake, storage, and efflux in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes is necessary for planning effective strategies for iron management during CNS development as well as for the treatment of demyelinating diseases.},

There is increasing evidence that these microstructural properties alter signal in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) driven by magnetic susceptibility of different compartments (e.g., myelin sheaths and iron-laden cells). To explain these observations, we have developed a multi-compartmental geometric model of whitematter microstructure. Using a single set of literature parameters, this forward model predicts experimentally observed orientation dependence and temporal evolution of the MRI signal. Where previous models have aimed to explain only the orientation dependence of signal phase, the proposed approach encapsulates the full repertoire of signal behavior. The frequency distribution underlying signal behavior is predicted to be a rich source of microstructural information with relevance to neuronal pathology.},

The severity of IVH is variable, ranging from a tiny germinal matrix bleed to a moderate-to-large ventricular hemorrhage or periventricular hemorrhagic infarction. Survivors with IVH often suffer from hydrocephalus and white matter injury. There is no tangible treatment to prevent post-hemorrhagic cerebral palsy, cognitive deficits, or hydrocephalus in these infants. White matter injury is attributed to blood-induced damage to axons and maturing oligodendrocyte precursors, resulting in reduced myelination and axonal loss. Hydrocephalus results from obstructed CSF circulation by blood clots, increased CSF production, and reduced CSF absorption by lymphatics and arachnoid villi. Several strategies to promote neurological recovery have shown promise in animal models, including the elimination of blood and blood products, alleviating cerebral inflammation and oxidative stress, as well as promoting survival and maturation of oligodendrocyte precursors. The present review integrates novel mechanisms of brain injury in IVH and the imminent therapies to alleviate post-hemorrhagic white matter injury and hydrocephalus in the survivors with IVH.},

However, there is a lack of prospective study about the influence of early term and late preterm birth on infants' neurodevelopment, especially at the early stage. Therefore, we conducted this cohort study to investigate the impact of early term and late preterm birth on infants' neurodevelopment within 6 months.                                         Methods               This cohort study was conducted in Wuhan, China, between October 2012 and September 2013. A total of 4243 singleton infants born within 34-41\,weeks of gestation at Wuhan Children's Hospital were included. The Gesell Developmental Scale (GDS) was utilized to evaluate the neurodevelopment of infants.                                         Results                                Among the 4243 included participants, 155 (3.65\%) were late preterm infants, 1288 (30.36\%) were early term infants, and 2800 (65.99\%) were full term infants. After adjusted for potential confounders, significant negative relationship was shown between late preterm birth and development quotient (DQ) in all domains of neurodevelopment: gross motor (                 {$\beta$}                 \,=\,-\,17.42, 95\%                 CI                 : -\,21.15 to -\,13.69), fine motor (                 {$\beta$}                 \,=\,-\,23.61, 95\%                 CI                 : -\,28.52 to -\,18.69), adaptability (                 {$\beta$}                 \,=\,-\,10.10, 95\%                 CI                 : -\,13.82 to -\,6.38), language (                 {$\beta$}                 \,=\,-\,6.28, 95\%                 CI                 : -\,9.82 to -\,2.74) and social behavior (                 {$\beta$}                 \,=\,-\,5.99, 95\%                 CI                 : -\,9.59 to -\,2.39). There was a significant negative trend for early term birth in DQ of fine motor (                 {$\beta$}                 \,=\,-\,2.01, 95\%                 CI                 : -\,3.93 to -\,0.09). Late preterm infants had a significantly elevated risk of neurodevelopmental delay in domains of gross motor (adjusted                 OR                 \,=\,3.82, 95\%                 CI                 : 2.67 to 5.46), fine motor (adjusted                 OR                 \,=\,3.51, 95\%                 CI                 : 2.47 to 5.01), and adaptability (adjusted                 OR                 \,=\,1.60, 95\%                 CI                 : 1.12 to 2.29), whereas early term birth was significantly associated with neurodevelopmental delay of fine motor (adjusted                 OR                 \,=\,1.22, 95\%                 CI                 : 1.05 to 1.42).                                                        Conclusions               This study suggested that late preterm birth mainly elevated the risk of neurodevelopmental delay of gross motor, fine motor, and adaptability, whereas early term birth was associated with the developmental delay of fine motor within 6 months. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and necessity of the interventions at the early stage for early term and late preterm infants who had suspected neurodevelopmental delay.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions show differing degrees of demyelination and remyelination. Changes in myelin content are associated with changes in magnetization transfer on MRI. Since acute inflammation and demyelination are spatially and temporally inhomogeneous, we hypothesized that local magnetic transfer ratio (MTR) heterogeneity might be predictive of subsequent changes in MTR. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed MTR images obtained in 14 subjects, at baseline and after 2 months follow-up. We segmented lesions and normal-appearing white-matter (NAWM), calculated MTR signal inhomogeneity maps at baseline and MTR lesion difference maps between baseline and follow-up. We found that regions with low MTR inhomogeneity at baseline experienced little further change in MTR on follow-up. The mean change in lesion MTR between baseline and follow-up was 0.10 +/- 3.70; in NAWM it was -0.09 +/- 2.02. We found that regions with high MTR inhomogeneity at baseline would change MTR on follow-up: (1) voxels with significantly high MTR in regions of high MTR inhomogeneity at baseline showed a mean decrease in MTR between baseline and follow-up of -2.51 +/- 4.68 in lesions and -1.41 +/- 3.00 in NAWM; (2) voxels with low MTR in regions of high MTR inhomogeneity at baseline showed a mean increase in MTR between baseline and follow-up of 2.61 +/- 6.07 in lesions. These changes in MTR were significantly different (P {$<$} 0.001). These results suggest that calculation of MTR signal inhomogeneity may provide a method for quantifying the potential for remyelination and demyelination, and thus could provide an important MRI biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapies targeting remyelination.},

  abstract = {The effect of extra-fiber structural and pathological components confounding diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) computation was quantitatively investigated using data generated by both Monte-Carlo simulations and tissue phantoms. Increased extent of vasogenic edema, by addition of various amount of gel to fixed normal mouse trigeminal nerves or by increasing non-restricted isotropic diffusion tensor components in Monte-Carlo simulations, significantly decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased radial diffusivity, while less significantly increased axial diffusivity derived by DTI. Increased cellularity, mimicked by graded increase of the restricted isotropic diffusion tensor component in Monte-Carlo simulations, significantly decreased FA and axial diffusivity with limited impact on radial diffusivity derived by DTI. The MC simulation and tissue phantom data were also analyzed by the recently developed diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) to simultaneously distinguish and quantify the axon/myelin integrity and extra-fiber diffusion components. Results showed that increased cellularity or vasogenic edema did not affect the DBSI-derived fiber FA, axial or radial diffusivity. Importantly, the extent of extra-fiber cellularity and edema estimated by DBSI correlated with experimentally added gel and Monte-Carlo simulations. We also examined the feasibility of applying 25-direction diffusion encoding scheme for DBSI analysis on coherent white matter tracts. Results from both phantom experiments and simulations suggested that the 25-direction diffusion scheme provided comparable DBSI estimation of both fiber diffusion parameters and extra-fiber cellularity/edema extent as those by 99-direction scheme. An in vivo 25-direction DBSI analysis was performed on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE, an animal model of human multiple sclerosis) optic nerve as an example to examine the validity of derived DBSI parameters with post-imaging immunohistochemistry verification. Results support that in vivo DBSI using 25-direction diffusion scheme correctly reflect the underlying axonal injury, demyelination, and inflammation of optic nerves in EAE mice.},

This study sought to identify differences in cognitive function in children born very preterm compared to term-born controls and investigate alteration in white matter microstructure and functional connectivity (FC) based on tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and resting-state functional MRI, respectively. At 6~years of age, 36 children born very preterm ({$<$}\,32~weeks' gestation) without major neurological disabilities and 26 term-born controls were tested using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition, and Child Behavior Checklist. Whole-brain deterministic tractography and FC measurements were performed in both groups. The very preterm group had significantly lower intelligence scores than the term-born controls. The TBSS revealed no significant differences between the two groups, whereas FC was significantly increased between the frontoparietal network and the language network and was significantly decreased between the right salience network nodes in the very preterm group. The altered FC patterns between specific regions of the higher-order networks may reflect underlying deficits in the functional network architecture associated with cognitive function. Further studies are needed to demonstrate a direct connection between FC in these regions and cognitive function.},

Global tractography methods aim at reconstructing the full-brain fiber configuration that best explains the measured data, based on a generative signal model. In this work, we incorporate a multi-shell multi-tissue model based on spherical convolution, into a global tractography framework, which allows to deal with partial volume effects. The required tissue response functions can be estimated from and hence calibrated to the data. The resulting track reconstruction is quantitatively related to the apparent fiber density in the data. In addition, the fiber orientation distribution for white matter and the volume fractions of gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid are produced as ancillary results. Validation results on simulated data demonstrate that this data-driven approach improves over state-of-the-art streamline and global tracking methods, particularly in the valid connection rate. Results in human brain data correspond to known white matter anatomy and show improved modeling of partial voluming. This work is an important step toward detecting and quantifying white matter changes and connectivity in healthy subjects and patients.},

  abstract = {Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is observed commonly in traumatically brain injured humans. However, traditional histologic methods have proven of limited use in identifying reactive axonal change early ({$<$} 12 h) in the posttraumatic course. Recently, we have reported, in both humans and animals, that antibodies targeting neurofilament subunits are useful in the light microscopic recognition of early reactive change. In the present study, we extend our previous efforts in humans by analyzing the progression of traumatic brain injury (TBI)-induced axonal change at the ultrastructural level. This effort was initiated to follow the subcellular progression of reactive axonal change in humans and to determine whether this progression parallels that described in animals. Two commercially prepared antibodies were used to recognize reactive axonal change in patients surviving from 6 to 88 h. The NR4 antibody was used to target the light neurofilament subunit (NF-L), and the SMI32 antibody was used to target the heavy neurofilament subunit (NF-H). Plastic-embedded tissue sections were screened for evidence of reactive axonal change, and once identified, this reactive change was analyzed at the ultrastructural level. At 6 h survival, focally enlarged, immunoreactive axons with axolemmal infolding or disordered neurofilaments were seen within fields of axons exhibiting no apparent abnormality. By 12 h, some axons exhibited continued neurofilamentous misalignment, pronounced immunoreactivity, vacuolization, and, occasionally, disconnection. At later stages, specifically 30 and 60 h survival, further accumulation of neurofilaments and organelles had led to the further expansion of the axis cylinder, and clearly disconnected reactive swellings were recognized. These contained a dense core of disordered immunoreactive neurofilaments partially encompassed by a cap of less densely aggregated organelles. At 88 h, the reactive axons were larger and elongated, consistent with the continued delivery of organelles by axoplasmic transport. At the later time points, considerable heterogeneity was observed, with focally enlarged disconnected axons being observed in relation to axons showing less advanced reactive change. Our findings suggest that neurofilamentous disruption is a pivotal event in axonal injury.},

While a statistical description of surface topography can be obtained from a power spectral density (PSD) analysis of atomic force microscopy (AFM) height maps and fitting the self-affine region of the PSD to determine the Hurst exponent (H), the accuracy of this approach has not been rigorously evaluated yet. Here, we use a Fourier filtering algorithm combined with a novel approach to simulate typical AFM scan-line anisotropy to generate synthetic AFM topography images with known input Hurst exponent. These synthetic AFM images are used as a Monte Carlo experiment to evaluate the variance and bias in H estimation from PSDs across different hypothetical experimental approaches, including the case of a cluster of images collected at one scan size (scale) and the case of a cluster of images collected at different scales. Our analysis reveals that estimates of the Hurst exponent from images collected at a single scale are persistently biased in a scale-dependent fashion despite misleading convergence in variance. This bias can be reduced by combining images collected at least at three different scales across the range of scales accessible to AFM.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Stressful life events are related to negative outcomes, including physical and psychological manifestations of distress, and behavioral deficits. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer report impaired attention and working memory prior to adjuvant therapy, which may be induced by distress. In this article, we examine whether brain dynamics show systematic changes due to the distress associated with cancer diagnosis. We hypothesized that impaired working memory is associated with suppression of ``long-memory'' neuronal dynamics; we tested this by measuring scale-free (``fractal'') brain dynamics, quantified by the Hurst exponent (               H               ). Fractal scaling refers to signals that do not occur at a specific time-scale, possessing a spectral power curve                              ; they are ``long-memory'' processes, with significant autocorrelations. In a BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we scanned three groups during a working memory task: women scheduled to receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy and aged-matched controls. Surprisingly, patients' BOLD signal exhibited greater               H               with increasing intensity of anticipated treatment. However, an analysis of               H               and functional connectivity against self-reported measures of psychological distress (Worry, Anxiety, Depression) and physical distress (Fatigue, Sleep problems) revealed significant interactions. The modulation of (Worry, Anxiety) versus (Fatigue, Sleep Problems, Depression) showed the strongest effect, where higher worry and lower fatigue was related to reduced               H               in regions involved in visuospatial search, attention, and memory processing. This is also linked to decreased functional connectivity in these brain regions. Our results indicate that the distress associated with cancer diagnosis alters BOLD scaling, and               H               is a sensitive measure of the interaction between psychological versus physical distress.

This is usually achieved using model-based approaches. Here, we propose an alternative exploratory analysis. The originality of this contribution is twofold. First, we propose a synthetic, consistent, and comparative overview of the various stochastic processes and estimation procedures used to model and analyze scale invariance. Notably, it is explained how multifractal models are more versatile to adjust the scaling properties of fMRI data but require more elaborated analysis procedures. Second, we bring evidence of the existence of actual scaling in fMRI time series that are clearly disentangled from putative superimposed nonstationarities. By nature, scaling analysis requires the use of long enough signals with high frequency sampling rate. To this end, we make use of a localized 3-D echo volume imaging (EVI) technique, which has recently emerged in fMRI because it allows very fast acquisitions of successive brain volumes. High temporal resolution EVI fMRI data have been acquired both in resting state and during a slow event-related visual paradigm. A voxel-based systematic multifractal analysis has been performed over both kinds of data. Combining multifractal attribute estimates together with paired statistical tests, we observe significant scaling parameter changes between ongoing and evoked brain activity, which clearly validate an increase in long memory and suggest a global multifractality decrease effect under activation.},

  abstract = {A primary goal of investigations into the organization of human cerebral cortex is to determine the functional specificity of architectonic regions. This includes the correlation of neurobehavioral deficits with neuropathological data for clinical diagnosis and treatment, and the identification of active brain regions using functional neural imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography, electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic (EEG and MEG) source localization algorithms, and direct cortical stimulation. Currently, the architectonic classification of a cortical region identified by these methods is inferred from the comparison of its cerebral topographic position to cytoarchitectonic brain atlases. However, substantial intersubject variability in the position of cytoarchitectonic regions with respect to cerebral topographic landmarks may lead to errors in this procedure. An alternative method is presented here, which uses magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to identify myeloarchitectonic regions of isocortex directly by estimating the relative concentration of myelin within cortical laminae. This high-resolution MR protocol is used to identify striate cortex (Brodmann's area 17) and extrastriate cortex in vivo. Correspondence of MR signal intensity with myeloarchitectonic data from a postmortem brain confirms this identification. As MR imaging technology improves, this noninvasive method has the potential to identify and discriminate among at least 50 cortical regions in the living human brain.},

As such, it is unlikely that an explanatory framework focused upon any single scale will yield a comprehensive theory of brain activity and cognitive function. Modelling and analysis methods for neuroscience should aim to accommodate multiscale phenomena. Emerging research now suggests that multi-scale processes in the brain arise from so-called critical phenomena that occur very broadly in the natural world. Criticality arises in complex systems perched between order and disorder, and is marked by fluctuations that do not have any privileged spatial or temporal scale. We review the core nature of criticality, the evidence supporting its role in neural systems and its explanatory potential in brain health and disease.},

Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated a dependency between T{$_2$}* and orientation of white matter fibers with respect to the main magnetic field B{$_0$}. In this study we probed the potential of T{$_2$}* mapping at 7 T to provide new markers of cortical architecture. We acquired multi-echo measurements at 7 T and mapped T{$_2$}* over the entire cortex of eight healthy individuals using surface-based analysis. B{$_0$} dependence was tested by computing the angle \texttheta (z) between the normal of the surface and the direction of B{$_0$}, then fitting T{$_2$}*(\texttheta (z)) using model from the literature. Average T{$_2$}* in the cortex was 32.20 +/- 1.35 ms. Patterns of lower T{$_2$}* were detected in the sensorimotor, visual and auditory cortices, likely reflecting higher myelin content. Significantly lower T{$_2$}* was detected in the left hemisphere of the auditory region (p{$<$}0.005), suggesting higher myelin content, in accordance with previous investigations. B{$_0$} orientation dependence was detected in some areas of the cortex, the strongest being in the primary motor cortex (∆R{$_2$}*=4.10 Hz). This study demonstrates that quantitative T{$_2$}* measures at 7 T MRI can reveal patterns of cytoarchitectural organization of the human cortex in vivo and that B{$_0$} orientation dependence can probe the coherency and orientation of gray matter fibers in the cortex, shedding light into the potential use of this type of contrast to characterize cyto-/myeloarchitecture and to understand the pathophysiology of diseases associated with changes in iron and/or myelin concentration.},

  abstract = {This review deals with high b-value q-space diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) of neuronal tissues. It is well documented that at sufficiently high b-values (and high q-values) neuronal water signal decay in diffusion experiments is not mono-exponential. This implies the existence of more than one apparent diffusing component or evidence for restriction. The assignment of the different apparent diffusing components to real physical entities is not straightforward. However, the apparent slow diffusing component that was found to be restricted to a compartment of a few microns, if originating mainly from a specific pool and if assigned correctly, may potentially be used to obtain more specific MR images with regard to specific pathologies of the CNS. This review examines the utility of analyzing high b-value diffusion MRS and MRI data using the q-space approach introduced by Callaghan and by Cory and Garroway. This approach provides displacement probability maps that emphasize, at long diffusion times, the characteristics of the apparent slow diffusing component. Examples from excised spinal cord, where the experimental conditions for which the q-space analysis of MR diffusion data was developed can be met or approached will be presented. Then examples from human MS patients, where q-space requirement for the short gradient pulse is clearly violated, are presented. In the excised spinal cord studies, this approach was used to study spinal cord maturation and trauma, and was found to be more sensitive than other conventional methods in following spinal cord degeneration in an experimental model of vascular dementia (VaD). High b-value q-space DWI was also recently used to study healthy and MS diseased human brains. This approach was found to be very sensitive to the disease load in MS, compared with other conventional MRI methods, especially in the normal appearing white matter (NAWM) of MS brains. Finally, the potential diagnostic capacity embedded in high b-value q-space analyzed diffusion MR images is discussed. The potentials and caveats of this approach are outlined and experimental data are presented that show the effect of violating the short gradient pulse (SGP) approximation on the extracted parameters from the q-space analysis.},

Comparison with histopathology was done in the five patients that underwent surgery. All lesions, seen at 1.5 and 3~T, were also recognized on 7~T. At 7~T FLAIR highlighted the FCD-like lesions best, whereas T2 and T2* were deemed better suited to review structure and extent of the lesion. Image quality with the used 7~T MRI setup was higher than the quality with the used 3~T MRI setup. In 2 out of 11 patients diagnosis changed, in one after re-evaluation of the images, and in the other based on histopathology.

  abstract = {Axonal degeneration of white matter fibers is a key consequence of neuronal or axonal injury. It is characterized by a series of time-related events with initial axonal membrane collapse followed by myelin degradation being its major hallmarks. Standard imaging cannot differentiate these phenomena, which would be useful for clinical investigations of degeneration, regeneration and plasticity. Animal models suggest that diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) is capable of making such distinction. The applicability of this technique in humans would permit inferences on white matter microanatomy using a non-invasive technique. The surgical bisection of the anterior 2/3 of the corpus callosum for the palliative treatment of certain types of epilepsy serves as a unique opportunity to assess this method in humans. DTI was performed on three epilepsy patients before corpus callosotomy and at two time points (1 week and 2-4 months) after surgery. Tractography was used to define voxels of interest for analysis of mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy and eigenvalues. Diffusion anisotropy was reduced in a spatially dependent manner in the genu and body of the corpus callosum at 1 week and remained low 2-4 months after the surgery. Decreased anisotropy at 1 week was due to a reduction in parallel diffusivity (consistent with axonal fragmentation), whereas at 2-4 months, it was due to an increase in perpendicular diffusivity (consistent with myelin degradation). DTI is capable of non-invasively detecting, staging and following the microstructural degradation of white matter following axonal injury.},

  abstract = {Oligodendrocytes are the predominant iron-containing cells in the brain. Iron-containing oligodendrocytes are found near neuronal cell bodies, along blood vessels, and are particularly abundant within white matter tracts. Iron-positive cells in white matter are present from birth and eventually reside in defined patches of cells in the adult. These patches of iron-containing cells typically have a blood vessel in their center. Ferritin, the iron storage protein, is also expressed early in development in oligodendrocytes in a regional and cellular pattern similar to that seen for iron. Recently, the functionally distinct subunits of ferritin have been analyzed; only heavy (H)-chain ferritin is found in oligodendrocytes early in development. H-ferritin is associated with high iron utilization and low iron storage. Consistent with the expression of H-ferritin is the expression of transferrin receptors (for iron acquisition) on immature oligodendrocytes. Transferrin protein accumulation and mRNA expression in the brain are both dependent on a viable population of oligodendrocytes and may have an autocrine function to assist oligodendrocytes in iron acquisition. Although apparently the majority of oligodendrocytes in white matter tracts contain ferritin, transferrin, and iron, not all of them do, indicating that there is a subset of oligodendrocytes in white matter tracts. The only known function of oligodendrocytes is myelin production, and both a direct and indirect relationship exists between iron acquisition and myelin production. Iron is directly involved in myelin production as a required co-factor for cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis and indirectly because of its requirement for oxidative metabolism (which occurs in oligodendrocytes at a higher rate than other brain cells). Factors (such as cytokines) and conditions such as iron deficiency may reduce iron acquisition by oligodendrocytes and the susceptibility of oligodendrocytes to oxidative injury may be a result of their iron-rich cytoplasm. Thus, the many known phenomena that decrease oligodendrocyte survival and/or myelin production may mediate their effect through a final common pathway that involves disruptions in iron availability or intracellular management of iron.},

These areas include the anterior commissure, internal capsule, optic tract and radiations, fornix, mammillothalamic tract, superior frontooccipital fasciculus, cingulum, corpus callosum, uncinate fasciculus, and superior longitudinal fasciculus. All these pathways could be identified in normal subjects 3 years old and older when 1.5-T axial and coronal images of 50 adults and 17 children were reviewed. Correlation of the in vivo and postmortem MR appearance of two human brains with Perls and Luxol fast blue stains indicates that the short T2 reflects heavy myelination and fiber density, not iron deposition. This is in contrast to the short T2 signal seen in the subcortical U fibers and deep nuclei of the brain that result from iron deposition. These pathways also differ from areas of brain iron accumulation in that (1) they may appear as areas of short T1 on partial-saturation or inversion-recovery pulse sequences and (2) they can be seen with regularity in all patients over 3 years of age. It is important to distinguish between the effect of the myelin sheath and the effect of brain iron on the T2 relaxation values seen in the normal brain since both result in shortened T2 relaxation. The importance of the role of these fiber tracts in disease processes and in modifying the spread of vasogenic edema and tumor needs further investigation.},

  abstract = {Neuronal networks can present activity described by power-law distributed avalanches presumed to be a signature of a critical state. Here we study a random-neighbor network of excitable cellular automata coupled by dynamical synapses. The model exhibits a very similar to conservative self-organized criticality (SOC) models behavior even with dissipative bulk dynamics. This occurs because in the stationary regime the model is conservative on average, and, in the thermodynamic limit, the probability distribution for the global branching ratio converges to a delta-function centered at its critical value. So, this non-conservative model pertain to the same universality class of conservative SOC models and contrasts with other dynamical synapses models that present only self-organized quasi-criticality (SOqC). Analytical results show very good agreement with simulations of the model and enable us to study the emergence of SOC as a function of the parametric derivatives of the stationary branching ratio.},

RESEARCH DESIGN: Morphological and structural connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were acquired from 16 participants with mTBI and nine participants without previous head injury. MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Participants with mTBI had less prefrontal grey matter and lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the anterior corona radiata and internal capsule. Furthermore, PCS severity was associated with less parietal lobe grey matter and lower FA in the corpus callosum. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence for both white and grey matter damage in participants with mTBI over 1 year after injury. Furthermore, these structural changes are greater in those that report more PCS symptoms, suggesting a neurophysiological basis for these persistent symptoms.},

We examine common growth functions to find the most representative model of myelin maturation and subsequently use the best of these models to develop a continuous population-averaged, four-dimensional model of normative myelination. Through comparisons with an independent sample of 63 male children across the same age span, we show that the developed model is representative of this population. This work contributes to understanding the trajectory of myelination in healthy infants and toddlers, furthering our knowledge of early brain development, and provides a model that may be useful for identifying developmental abnormalities.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Neurobehavioral symptoms are not uncommon after a traumatic brain injury. However, psychiatric syndromes per se have rarely been studied in patients with such an injury. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the type and extent of psychiatric syndromes in patients with traumatic brain injury. METHOD: One hundred ninety-six hospitalized adults were studied 1 year after a traumatic brain injury with the use of a two-stage psychiatric diagnostic procedure. Psychiatric diagnoses were made according to ICD-10 criteria on the basis of data from the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry interview. RESULTS: Of 164 patients interviewed, 30 (18.3\%) had an ICD-10 diagnosis of a psychiatric illness. Among the 120 patients who were 18-64 years old, 21.7\% had a psychiatric illness, compared with 16.4\% in a study of the general population. A depressive illness was present in 13.9\% of the traumatic brain injury patients, compared with 2.1\% of the general population, and panic disorder was present in 9.0\%, compared with 0.8\% of the general population. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with the general population, a higher proportion of adult patients had developed psychiatric illnesses 1 year after a traumatic brain injury; the rates of depressive episode and panic disorder were significantly higher in the study group. A history of psychiatric illness, an unfavorable global outcome according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale, a lower score on the Mini-Mental State examination, and fewer years of formal education seemed to be important risk factors in the development of a psychiatric illness. Compensation claims, however, were not associated with the rate of psychiatric illness.},

With the recently introduced method of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and its conceptual extension to susceptibility tensor imaging (STI), the non-invasive assessment of this important physical quantity has become possible with MRI. Both methods solve the ill-posed inverse problem to determine the magnetic susceptibility from local magnetic fields. Whilst QSM allows the extraction of the spatial distribution of the bulk magnetic susceptibility from a single measurement, STI enables the quantification of magnetic susceptibility anisotropy, but requires multiple measurements with different orientations of the object relative to the main static magnetic field. In this review, we briefly recapitulate the fundamental theoretical foundation of QSM and STI, as well as computational strategies for the characterization of magnetic susceptibility with MRI phase data. In the second part, we provide an overview of current methodological and clinical applications of QSM with a focus on brain imaging. Copyright \copyright{} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this retrospective study, with waiver of informed consent. FA maps were obtained and neurocognitive testing was performed in 74 patients with mTBI (57 with PTM, 17 without PTM). FA maps were obtained in 22 healthy control subjects and in 20 control patients with migraine headaches. Mean FA and SE were extracted from total brain FA histograms and were compared between patients with mTBI and control subjects and between patients with and those without PTM. Mean FA and SE were correlated with clinical variables and were used to determine the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) and likelihood ratios for mTBI and development of PTM. Results Patients with mTBI had significantly lower SE (P {$<$} .001) and trended toward lower mean FA (P = .07) compared with control subjects. SE inversely correlated with time to recovery (TTR) (r = -0.272, P = .02). Patients with mTBI with PTM had significantly lower SE (P {$<$} .001) but not mean FA (P = .15) than did other patients with mTBI. SE provided better discrimination between patients with mTBI and control subjects than mean FA (AUC = 0.92; P = .01), as well as better discrimination between patients with mTBI with PTM and those without PTM (AUC = 0.85; P {$<$} .001). SE of less than 0.751 resulted in a 16.1 increased likelihood of having experienced mTBI and a 3.2 increased likelihood of developing PTM. Conclusion SE more accurately reveals mTBI than mean FA, more accurately reveals those patients with mTBI who develop PTM, and inversely correlates with TTR. (\copyright ) RSNA, 2016.},

Significant developments in magnetic resonance diffusion imaging, involving voxel-based quantitative analysis through the measurement of fractional anisotropy or mean diffusivity, have enhanced our knowledge on the different stages of mTBI pathophysiology. Other diffusion imaging-derived techniques, including diffusion kurtosis imaging with multi-shell diffusion and high-order tractography models, have recently demonstrated their usefulness in mTBI. Our review starts by briefly outlining the physical basis of diffusion tensor imaging including the pitfalls for use in brain trauma, before discussing findings from diagnostic trials testing its usefulness in assessing brain structural changes in patients with mTBI. Use of different post-processing techniques for the diffusion imaging data, identified the corpus callosum as the most frequently injured structure in mTBI, particularly at sub-acute and chronic stages, and a crucial location for evaluating functional outcome. However, structural changes appear too subtle for identification using traditional diffusion biomarkers, thus disallowing expansion of these techniques into clinical practice. In this regard, more advanced diffusion techniques are promising in the assessment of this complex disease.},

The local angle between white matter fibres and the main magnetic field was computed from the principal diffusion direction. The phase and signal decay of the gradient-echo images revealed a characteristic relationship with fibre orientation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three-dimensional multi echo gradient echo data were acquired with five equidistant echoes ranging from 13 to 41 ms. The phase images of each echo were filtered with filter parameters adjusted to the echo time, converted into a phase mask, and combined with the corresponding magnitude images to obtain susceptibility weighted images. The individual images were then averaged. Conventional single echo data were acquired for comparison. Maps of R(2) relaxation rates were computed from the magnitude data. Field maps derived from the phase data were used to correct R(2) for the influences from background inhomogeneities of the static magnetic field. RESULTS: Compared with the single echo images, the combined images had an increase in SNR by 46\% and an improvement in CNR by 34 to 80\%, improved visibility of small venous vessels and reduced blurring along the readout direction. The R(2) values of different tissue types are in good agreement with values from the literature. CONCLUSION: Acquisition of SWI with multiple echoes leads to an increase in SNR and CNR and it allows the computation of high resolution maps of R(2) relaxation.},

  abstract = {The elaboration of the myelinated white matter is essential for normal neurodevelopment, establishing and mediating rapid communication pathways throughout the brain. These pathways facilitate the synchronized communication required for higher order behavioral and cognitive functioning. Altered neural messaging (or 'disconnectivity') arising from abnormal white matter and myelin development may underlie a number of neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders. Despite the vital role myelin plays, few imaging studies have specifically examined its maturation throughout early infancy and childhood. Thus, direct investigations of the relationship(s) between evolving behavioral and cognitive functions and the myelination of the supporting neural systems have been sparse. Further, without knowledge of the 'normative' developmental time-course, identification of early abnormalities associated with developmental disorders remains challenging. In this work, we examined the use of longitudinal (T(1)) and transverse (T(2)) relaxation time mapping, and myelin water fraction (MWF) imaging to investigate white matter and myelin development in 153 healthy male and female children, 3 months through 60 months in age. Optimized age-specific acquisition protocols were developed using the DESPOT and mcDESPOT imaging techniques; and mean T(1), T(2) and MWF trajectories were determined for frontal, temporal, occipital, parietal and cerebellar white matter, and genu, body and splenium of the corpus callosum. MWF results provided a spatio-temporal pattern in-line with prior histological studies of myelination. Comparison of T(1), T(2) and MWF measurements demonstrates dissimilar sensitivity to tissue changes associated with neurodevelopment, with each providing differential but complementary information.},

  abstract = {Myelination, the elaboration of myelin surrounding neuronal axons, is essential for normal brain function. The development of the myelin sheath enables rapid synchronized communication across the neural systems responsible for higher order cognitive functioning. Despite this critical role, quantitative visualization of myelination in vivo is not possible with current neuroimaging techniques including diffusion tensor and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although these techniques offer insight into structural maturation, they reflect several different facets of development, e.g., changes in axonal size, density, coherence, and membrane structure; lipid, protein, and macromolecule content; and water compartmentalization. Consequently, observed signal changes are ambiguous, hindering meaningful inferences between imaging findings and metrics of learning, behavior or cognition. Here we present the first quantitative study of myelination in healthy human infants, from 3 to 11 months of age. Using a new myelin-specific MRI technique, we report a spatiotemporal pattern beginning in the cerebellum, pons, and internal capsule; proceeding caudocranially from the splenium of the corpus callosum and optic radiations (at 3-4 months); to the occipital and parietal lobes (at 4-6 months); and then to the genu of the corpus callosum and frontal and temporal lobes (at 6-8 months). Our results also offer preliminary evidence of hemispheric myelination rate differences. This work represents a significant step forward in our ability to appreciate the fundamental process of myelination, and provides the first ever in vivo visualization of myelin maturation in healthy human infancy.},

  abstract = {Perinatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) is still a significant contributor to mortality and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in term and preterm infants. HI brain injury evolves over hours to days, and involves complex interactions between the endogenous protective and pathological processes. Understanding the timing of evolution of injury is vital to guide treatment. Post-HI recovery is associated with a typical neurophysiological profile, with stereotypic changes in cerebral perfusion and oxygenation. After the initial recovery, there is a delayed, prolonged reduction in cerebral perfusion related to metabolic suppression, followed by secondary deterioration with hyperperfusion and increased cerebral oxygenation, associated with altered neurovascular coupling and impaired cerebral autoregulation. These changes in cerebral perfusion are associated with the stages of evolution of injury and injury severity. Further, iatrogenic factors can also affect cerebral oxygenation during the early period of deranged metabolism, and improving clinical management may improve neuroprotection. We will review recent evidence that changes in cerebral oxygenation and metabolism after HI may be useful biomarkers of prognosis.},

CBF was measured by both DCS and contrast-enhanced NIRS for comparison. No significant difference in the treatment-induced CBF decrease was found between DCS (27.9 \textpm{} 2.2\%) and NIRS (26.5 \textpm{} 4.3\%). A reduction in StO2 (70.5 \textpm{} 2.4\% to 63.7 \textpm{} 2.9\%) was measured by broadband NIRS, reflecting the increase in oxygen extraction required to maintain CMRO2. This study demonstrates the applicability of broadband NIRS combined with DCS for neuromonitoring in this patient population.},

  abstract = {Increased iron in subcortical gray matter (GM) structures of patients with Huntington's disease (HD) has been suggested as a causal factor in neuronal degeneration. But how iron content is related to white matter (WM) changes in HD is still unknown. For example, it is not clear whether WM changes share the same physiopathology (i.e. iron accumulation) with GM or whether there is a different mechanism. The present study used MRI to examine iron content in premanifest gene carriers (PreHD, n = 25) and in early HD patients (n = 25) compared with healthy controls (n = 50). 3T MRI acquisitions included high resolution 3D T1, EPI sequences for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as an indirect measure of tissue integrity, and T2*-weighted gradient echo-planar imaging for MR-based relaxometry (R2*), which provides an indirect measure of ferritin/iron deposition in the brain. Myelin breakdown starts in the PreHD stage, but there is no difference in iron content values. Iron content reduction manifests later, in the early HD stage, in which we found a lower R2* parameter value in the isthmus. The WM iron reduction in HD is temporally well-defined (no iron differences in PreHD subjects and iron differences only in early HD patients). Iron level in callosal WM may be regarded as a marker of disease state, as iron does not differentiate PreHD subjects from controls but distinguishes between PreHD and HD.

Its higher energy consumption compared to other brain networks and its intimate coupling with conscious awareness are both pointing to an unknown overarching function. Many research streams speak in favor of an evolutionarily adaptive role in envisioning experience to anticipate the future. In the present work, we propose aprocess modelthat tries to explainhowthe DMN may implement continuous evaluation and prediction of the environment to guide behavior. The main purpose of DMN activity, we argue, may be described by Markov decision processes that optimize action policies via value estimates through vicarious trial and error. Our formal perspective on DMN function naturally accommodates as special cases previous interpretations based on (a) predictive coding, (b) semantic associations, and (c) a sentinel role. Moreover, this process model for the neural optimization of complex behavior in the DMN offers parsimonious explanations for recent experimental findings in animals and humans.},

According to the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) theory, environmental factors influence the offspring and also affect health in adulthood. Recently, studies based on this theory have gained attracted attention because of their clinical utility in identifying the risk groups for various diseases. Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be caused by exposure to certain prenatal environments during pregnancy. This review describes the latest findings on the effect of prenatal environment on the onset mechanism of NDDs based on the DOHaD theory. Unravelling the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of NDDs is important, because there are no therapeutic drugs for these disorders. Furthermore, elucidating the relationship between the DOHaD theory and NDDs will contribute to the popularization of preventive medicine.},

We compared global cerebral blood flow measurements obtained using pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling and phase contrast in 436 middle-aged subjects acquired at two sites in the NHLBI CARDIA multisite study. Cerebral blood flow measured by phase contrast (CBFPC: 55.76\,\textpm\,12.05\,ml/100\,g/min) was systematically higher (p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and more variable than cerebral blood flow measured by pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (CBFPCASL: 47.70\,\textpm\,9.75). The correlation between global cerebral blood flow values obtained from the two modalities was 0.59 (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), explaining less than half of the observed variance in cerebral blood flow estimates. Well-established correlations of global cerebral blood flow with age and sex were similarly observed in both CBFPCASL and CBFPC CBFPC also demonstrated statistically significant site differences, whereas no such differences were observed in CBFPCASL No consistent velocity-dependent effects on pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling were observed, suggesting that pseudo-continuous labeling efficiency does not vary substantially across typical adult carotid and vertebral velocities, as has previously been suggested. CONCLUSIONS: Although CBFPCASL and CBFPC values show substantial similarity across the entire cohort, these data do not support calibration of CBFPCASL using CBFPC in individual subjects. The wide-ranging cerebral blood flow values obtained by both methods suggest that cerebral blood flow values are highly variable in the general population.},

Emerging evidence demonstrates that the aperiodic component has putative physiological interpretations and that it dynamically changes with age, task demands and cognitive states. Electrophysiological neural activity is typically analyzed using canonically defined frequency bands, without consideration of the aperiodic (1/f-like) component. We show that standard analytic approaches can conflate periodic parameters (center frequency, power, bandwidth) with aperiodic ones (offset, exponent), compromising physiological interpretations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an algorithm to parameterize neural power spectra as a combination of an aperiodic component and putative periodic oscillatory peaks. This algorithm requires no a priori specification of frequency bands. We validate this algorithm on simulated data, and demonstrate how it can be used in applications ranging from analyzing age-related changes in working memory to large-scale data exploration and analysis.},

We tested the alternative hypothesis: that the full repertoire of resting state dynamics emerges during the period of rapid neural growth before the normal time of birth at term (around 40 wk of gestation). We used a series of independent analytical techniques to map in detail the development of different networks in 70 infants born between 29 and 43 wk of postmenstrual age (PMA). We characterized and charted the development of RSNs from recognizable but often fragmentary elements at 30 wk of PMA to full facsimiles of adult patterns at term. Visual, auditory, somatosensory, motor, default mode, frontoparietal, and executive control networks developed at different rates; however, by term, complete networks were present, several of which were integrated with thalamic activity. These results place the emergence of RSNs largely during the period of rapid neural growth in the third trimester of gestation, suggesting that they are formed before the acquisition of cognitive competencies in later childhood.},

We present a rapid numerical framework for the solution of the Bloch-Torrey equation that allows us to explore the isotropic and anisotropic components of the vascular tree. By fitting the simulated spin echo DSC signal to the measured data, we show that half of the WM vascular volume is comprised of vessels running in parallel with WM fibre tracts. The WM blood volume corresponding to the best fit to the experimental data was 2.82\%, which is close to the PET gold standard of 2.6\%.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) occurs in 1 to 8 per 1000 live births in developed countries. Historically, the clinician has had little to offer neonates with HIE other than systemic supportive care. Recently, the neuroprotective therapy of hypothermia has emerged as the standard of care, and other complementary therapies are rapidly transitioning from the basic science to clinical care. OBJECTIVE: To examine the pathophysiology of HIE and the state of the art for the clinical care of neonates with HIE. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We performed a literature review using the PubMed database. Results focused on reviews and articles published from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2014. Articles published earlier than 2004 were included when appropriate for historical perspective. Our review emphasized evidence-based management practices for the clinician. FINDINGS: A total of 102 articles for critical review were selected based on their relevance to the incidence of HIE, pathophysiology, neuroimaging, placental pathology, biomarkers, current systemic supportive care, hypothermia, and emerging therapies for HIE and were reviewed by both of us. Seventy-five publications were selected for inclusion in this article based on their relevance to these topics. The publications highlight the emergence of serum-based biomarkers, placental pathology, and magnetic resonance imaging as useful tools to predict long-term outcomes. Hypothermia and systemic supportive care form the cornerstone of therapy for HIE. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The pathophysiology of HIE is now better understood, and treatment with hypothermia has become the foundation of therapy. Several neuroprotective agents offer promise when combined with hypothermia and are entering clinical trials.},

  abstract = {While the newborn's brain is functionally organised early on---with similar resting state networks as those of adults present at birth---these networks continue to develop at different rates and in complex ways over time. While most in vivo functional imaging studies examine the spatial characteristics of resting state networks (RSNs), such as their size or the degree of connectivity, the temporal characteristics of these networks are less well characterised. We set out to examine the long-range temporal correlation (LRTC) of the fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal using the Hurst exponent in various RSNs in infants born very preterm shortly after birth ({$<$} 32 weeks gestational age; n = 64) and again later at term equivalent age (TEA) (n = 69). The Hurst exponent in grey matter and white matter was 0.69 at preterm age and increased significantly to 0.80 at TEA, with a greater difference between the tissues at TEA. The Hurst exponent in RSNs similarly was found to be approximately 0.68 for most networks at preterm age but increased significantly at different rates by TEA: 0.77 and 0.76 in the cerebellum and frontal networks respectively, and 0.84 and 0.83 in the motor and visual networks respectively. This pattern is partly consistent with findings from previous functional connectivity fMRI studies that the general growth and maturation of RSNs occur first and develop more quickly in sensory and motor networks, but later in associative networks like frontal ones. Importantly, this is the first time that this pattern has been shown in the LRTC of the fMRI BOLD signal itself, an area of study that may provide greater insight into functional brain development.},

As the in vivo brain is less dense than the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), one hypothesis explaining this observation is that upon skull impact, the denser CSF moves toward the site of skull impact displacing the brain in the opposite direction, such that the initial impact of the brain parenchyma is at the contrecoup location. A simple model was developed consisting of a balloon filled with water of density 1.00 g/mL enclosed in a clear plastic jar containing salt water of density 1.04 g/mL, simulating the same relative densities of the CSF and brain. The initial movement of the balloon, modeling the brain, was toward the contrecoup location with subsequent movement toward the coup location. The pattern of brain injury in which the contrecoup injury is greater than the coup injury is a result of initial movement of the brain in the contrecoup location. During the process of closed head injury, the brain parenchyma is initially displaced away from the site of skull impact and toward the contrecoup site resulting in the more severe brain contusion.},

  abstract = {Very preterm human neonates are exposed to numerous invasive procedures as part of life-saving care. Evidence suggests that repetitive neonatal procedural pain precedes long-term alterations in brain development. However, to date the link between pain and brain development has limited temporal and anatomic specificity. We hypothesized that early exposure to painful stimuli during a period of rapid brain development, before pain modulatory systems reach maturity, will predict pronounced changes in thalamic development, and thereby cognitive and motor function. In a prospective cohort study, 155 very preterm neonates (82 males, 73 females) born 24--32 weeks' gestation underwent two MRIs at median postmenstrual ages 32 and 40 weeks that included structural, metabolic, and diffusion imaging. Detailed day-by-day clinical data were collected. Cognitive and motor abilities were assessed at 3 years, corrected age. The association of early (skin breaks, birth--Scan 1) and late pain (skin breaks, Scans 1--2) with thalamic volumes and               N               -acetylaspartate (NAA)/choline (Cho), and fractional anisotropy of white-matter pathways was assessed. Early pain was associated with slower thalamic macrostructural growth, most pronounced in extremely premature neonates. Deformation-based morphometry analyses confirmed early pain-related volume losses were localized to somatosensory regions. In extremely preterm neonates early pain was associated with decreased thalamic NAA/Cho and microstructural alterations in thalamocortical pathways. Thalamic growth was in turn related to cognitive and motor outcomes. We observed regionally-specific alterations in the lateral thalamus and thalamocortical pathways in extremely preterm neonates exposed to more procedural pain. Findings suggest a sensitive period leading to lasting alterations in somatosensory-system development.                                         SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT               Early exposure to repetitive procedural pain in very preterm neonates may disrupt the development of regions involved in somatosensory processing, leading to poor functional outcomes. We demonstrate that early pain is associated with thalamic volume loss in the territory of the somatosensory thalamus and is accompanied by disruptions thalamic metabolic growth and thalamocortical pathway maturation, particularly in extremely preterm neonates. Thalamic growth was associated with cognitive and motor outcome at 3 years corrected age. Findings provide evidence for a developmentally sensitive period whereby subcortical structures in young neonates may be most vulnerable to procedural pain. Furthermore, results suggest that the thalamus may play a key role underlying the association between neonatal pain and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes in these high-risk neonates.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in neonatology have led to the increased survival of extremely low-birth weight infants. However, the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has not improved proportionally, partly due to increased survival of extremely premature infants born at the late-canalicular stage of lung development. Due to minimal surfactant production at this stage, these infants are at risk for severe respiratory distress syndrome, needing prolonged ventilation. While the etiology of BPD is multifactorial with antenatal, postnatal, and genetic factors playing a role, ventilator-induced lung injury is a major, potentially modifiable, risk factor implicated in its causation. Infants with BPD are at a higher risk of developing complications including sepsis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, respiratory failure, and death. Long-term problems include increased risk of hospital readmissions, respiratory infections, and asthma-like symptoms during infancy and childhood. Survivors who have BPD are also at increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. While the ultimate solution for avoiding BPD lies in the prevention of preterm births, strategies to decrease its incidence are the need of the hour. It is time to focus on gentler modes of ventilation and the use of less invasive surfactant administration techniques to mitigate lung injury, thereby potentially decreasing the burden of BPD. In this article, we discuss the use of non-invasive ventilation in premature infants, with an emphasis on studies showing an effect on BPD with different modes of non-invasive ventilation. Practical considerations in the use of nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation are also discussed, considering the significant heterogeneity in clinical practices and management strategies in its use.},

In this work, we show that in MRI of the human brain, large improvements in contrast to noise in high-resolution images are possible by exploiting the MRI signal phase at high magnetic field strength. Using gradient-echo MRI at 7.0 tesla and a multichannel detector, a nominal voxel size of 0.24 x 0.24 x 1.0 mm3 (58 nl) was achieved. At this resolution, a strong phase contrast was observed both between as well as within gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM). In gradient-echo phase images obtained on normal volunteers at this high resolution, the CNR between GM and WM ranged from 3:1 to 20:1 over the cortex. This CNR is an almost 10-fold improvement over conventional MRI techniques that do not use image phase, and it is an approximately 100-fold improvement when including the gains in resolution from high-field and multichannel detection. Within WM, phase contrast appeared to be associated with the major fiber bundles, whereas contrast within GM was suggestive of the underlying layer structure. The observed phase contrast is attributed to local variations in magnetic susceptibility, which, at least in part, appeared to originate from iron stores. The ability to detect cortical substructure from MRI phase contrast at high field is expected to greatly enhance the study of human brain anatomy in vivo.},

However, architectonic data require observations in a sample of postmortem brains.

The complete architectonic analysis of an individual living brain has not been achievable to date, because the relationship remains unclear between laminar gray value changes of cerebral cortex in magnetic resonance (MR) images and those of cyto- and myeloarchitectonic histologic sections. We examined intensity profiles through the cortex in five imaging modalities: in vivo T1 and postmortem T2 MRI, one cell body stain, and two myelin stains. After visualizing the dissimilarities in the shapes of these profiles using a canonical analysis, differences between the profiles from the different image modalities were compared quantitatively. Subsequently, the profiles extracted from the in vivo T1-weighted images were estimated from profiles extracted from cyto- and myeloarchitectonic sections using linear combinations. We could verify statistically the mixed nature of the cortical T1 signal obtained in vivo: The MR intensity profiles were significantly more similar to myeloarchitectonic than to cytoarchitectonic profiles, but a weighted sum of both fitted the T1 profiles best.},

  abstract = {This paper broadly reviews the study of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), across the spectrum of neuroimaging modalities. Among the range of imaging methods, however, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is unique in its applicability to studying both structure and function. Thus we additionally performed meta-analyses of MRI results to examine 1) the issue of anatomical variability and consistency for functional MRI (fMRI) findings, 2) the analogous issue of anatomical consistency for white-matter findings, and 3) the importance of accounting for the time post injury in diffusion weighted imaging reports. As we discuss, the human neuroimaging literature consists of both small and large studies spanning acute to chronic time points that have examined both structural and functional changes with mTBI, using virtually every available medical imaging modality. Two key commonalities have been used across the majority of imaging studies. The first is the comparison between mTBI and control populations. The second is the attempt to link imaging results with neuropsychological assessments. Our fMRI meta-analysis demonstrates a frontal vulnerability to mTBI, demonstrated by decreased signal in prefrontal cortex compared to controls. This vulnerability is further highlighted by examining the frequency of reported mTBI white matter anisotropy, in which we show a strong anterior-to-posterior gradient (with anterior regions being more frequently reported in mTBI). Our final DTI meta-analysis examines a debated topic arising from inconsistent anisotropy findings across studies. Our results support the hypothesis that acute mTBI is associated with elevated anisotropy values and chronic mTBI complaints are correlated with depressed anisotropy. Thus, this review and set of meta-analyses demonstrate several important points about the ongoing use of neuroimaging to understand the functional and structural changes that occur throughout the time course of mTBI recovery. Based on the complexity of mTBI, however, much more work in this area is required to characterize injury mechanisms and recovery factors and to achieve clinically-relevant capabilities for diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The Developing Human Connectome Project is an Open Science project that provides the first large sample of neonatal functional MRI data with high temporal and spatial resolution. These data enable mapping of intrinsic functional connectivity between spatially distributed brain regions under normal and adverse perinatal circumstances, offering a framework to study the ontogeny of large-scale brain organization in humans. Here, we characterize in unprecedented detail the maturation and integrity of resting state networks (RSNs) at term-equivalent age in 337 infants (including 65 born preterm). First, we applied group independent component analysis to define 11 RSNs in term-born infants scanned at 43.5--44.5\,weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Adult-like topography was observed in RSNs encompassing primary sensorimotor, visual and auditory cortices. Among six higher-order, association RSNs, analogues of the adult networks for language and ocular control were identified, but a complete default mode network precursor was not. Next, we regressed the subject-level datasets from an independent cohort of infants scanned at 37--43.5\,weeks PMA against the group-level RSNs to test for the effects of age, sex and preterm birth. Brain mapping in term-born infants revealed areas of positive association with age across four of six association RSNs, indicating active maturation in functional connectivity from 37 to 43.5\,weeks PMA. Female infants showed increased connectivity in inferotemporal regions of the visual association network. Preterm birth was associated with striking impairments of functional connectivity across all RSNs in a dose-dependent manner; conversely, connectivity of the superior parietal lobules within the lateral motor network was abnormally increased in preterm infants, suggesting a possible mechanism for specific difficulties such as developmental coordination disorder, which occur frequently in preterm children. Overall, we found a robust, modular, symmetrical functional brain organization at normal term age. A complete set of adult-equivalent primary RSNs is already instated, alongside emerging connectivity in immature association RSNs, consistent with a primary-to-higher order ontogenetic sequence of brain development. The early developmental disruption imposed by preterm birth is associated with extensive alterations in functional connectivity.},

Numerous tracer delivery, PET acquisition, and kinetic modeling approaches have been adopted to map brain oxygenation. The purpose of this technical review is to critically evaluate different methods for [15O]-gas PET and its impact on the accuracy and reproducibility of OEF and CMRO2 measurements. We perform a meta-analysis of brain oxygenation PET studies in healthy volunteers and compare between continuous and bolus inhalation techniques. We also describe OEF metrics that have been used to detect hemodynamic impairment in cerebrovascular disease. For these patients, advanced techniques to accelerate the PET scans and potential synthesis with MRI to avoid arterial blood sampling would facilitate broader use of [15O]-oxygen PET for brain physiological assessment.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To demonstrate acquisition and processing methods for quantitative oxygenation venograms that map in vivo oxygen saturation (SvO2 ) along cerebral venous vasculature. METHODS: Regularized quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is used to reconstruct susceptibility values and estimate SvO2 in veins. QSM with {$\ell$}1 and {$\ell$}2 regularization are compared in numerical simulations of vessel structures with known magnetic susceptibility. Dual-echo, flow-compensated phase images are collected in three healthy volunteers to create QSM images. Bright veins in the susceptibility maps are vectorized and used to form a three-dimensional vascular mesh, or venogram, along which to display SvO2 values from QSM. RESULTS: Quantitative oxygenation venograms that map SvO2 along brain vessels of arbitrary orientation and geometry are shown in vivo. SvO2 values in major cerebral veins lie within the normal physiological range reported by (15) O positron emission tomography. SvO2 from QSM is consistent with previous MR susceptometry methods for vessel segments oriented parallel to the main magnetic field. In vessel simulations, {$\ell$}1 regularization results in less than 10\% SvO2 absolute error across all vessel tilt orientations and provides more accurate SvO2 estimation than {$\ell$}2 regularization. CONCLUSION: The proposed analysis of susceptibility images enables reliable mapping of quantitative SvO2 along venograms and may facilitate clinical use of venous oxygenation imaging.},

STUDY DESIGN: College athletes (n = 371) and high school athletes (n = 183) underwent baseline neuropsychological evaluation between 1997 and 2000. Individuals who received a concussion during athletic competition (n = 54) underwent serial neuropsychologic evaluation after injury and were compared with a noninjured within-sample control group (n = 38). Main outcome measures included structured interview, four memory measures, and Concussion Symptom Scale ratings. Baseline to postinjury change scores and multiple analyses of variance were used to compare recovery curves within and between groups. RESULTS: High school athletes with concussion had prolonged memory dysfunction compared with college athletes with concussion. High school athletes performed significantly worse than age-matched control subjects at 7 days after injury (F = 2.90; P {$<$}.005). College athletes, despite having more severe in-season concussions, displayed commensurate performance with matched control subjects by day 3 after concussion. Self-report of postconcussion symptoms by student athletes was not predictive of poor performance on neuropsychologic testing. CONCLUSIONS: Caution and systematic evaluation should be undertaken before returning athletes with concussion to competition. Sole reliance on the self-report of the athlete may be inadequate. Preliminary data may suggest a more protracted recovery from concussion in high school athletes.},

Every 4 weeks for 3 months, 10 patients with relapsing-remitting MS were scanned with a T1-weighted sequence, 20 minutes after injection with 0.3 mmol/kg gadolinium-DTPA (Gd-DTPA). During each of the monthly sessions, MT and dual echo scans were also performed before Gd-DTPA injection. On coregistered images, the MT ratio (MTR) was measured in NAWM subsequently involved by enhancing lesions, in NAWM areas on the same slices but outside any present or future MR abnormality, and in enhancing lesions at the time of their appearance. Forty-eight new enhancing lesions with no corresponding abnormalities on previous scans were identified. Their average MTR was 33.1\% (+/-8.4\%). Three, 2, and 1 month before enhancement appearance, the mean MTR in NAWM, measured from areas corresponding to future enhancing lesions, was significantly lower than the mean MTR in NAWM outside enhancing areas; the MTR decreased steadily as the time when the enhanced lesion approached. These results suggest that changes in the NAWM of patients with MS occur before lesions become evident on conventional MRI scans.},

A decrease in MTR value has previously been shown to correlate to myelin loss in the mouse cuprizone model for demyelination. In this study, we investigated the sensitivity of MTR for demyelination in the myelin oligodendrocyte (MOG) 1-125 induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model. A total of 24 female c57Bl/6 mice were randomized to a control group (N\,=\,6) or EAE (N\,=\,18). MTR images were obtained at a preclinical 7 Tesla Bruker MR-scanner before EAE induction (baseline), 17-19 days (midpoint) and 31-32 days (endpoint) after EAE induction. Mean MTR values were calculated in five regions of the brain and compared to weight, EAE severity score and myelin content assessed by immunostaining for proteolipid protein and luxol fast blue, lymphocyte and monocyte infiltration and iron deposition. Contrary to what was expected, MTR values in the EAE mice were higher than in the control mice at the midpoint and endpoint. No significant difference in myelin content was found according to histo- or immunohistochemistry. Changes in MTR values did not correlate to myelin content, iron content, lymphocyte or monocyte infiltration, weight or EAE severity scores. This suggest that MTR measures of brain tissue can give significant differences between control mice and EAE mice not caused by demyelination, inflammation or iron deposition, and may not be useful surrogate markers for demyelination in the MOG1-125 mouse model.},

  abstract = {Axonal injury is an important contributor to the behavioral deficits observed following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Additionally, loss of myelin and/or oligodendrocytes can negatively influence signal transduction and axon integrity. Apoptotic oligodendrocytes, changes in the oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) population and loss of myelin were evaluated at 2, 7 and 21~days following TBI. We used the central fluid percussion injury model (n~=~18 and three controls) and the lateral fluid percussion injury model (n~=~15 and three controls). The external capsule, fimbriae and corpus callosum were analysed. With Luxol Fast Blue and RIP staining, myelin loss was observed in both models, in all evaluated regions and at all post-injury time points, as compared with sham-injured controls (P~{$\leq~$}0.05). Accumulation of {$\beta$}-amyloid precursor protein was observed in white matter tracts in both models in areas with preserved and reduced myelin staining. White matter microglial/macrophage activation, evaluated by isolectin B4 immunostaining, was marked at the early time points. In contrast, the glial scar, evaluated by glial fibrillary acidic protein staining, showed its highest intensity 21 days post-injury in both models. The number of apoptotic oligodendrocytes, detected by CC1/caspase-3 co-labeling, was increased in both models in all evaluated regions. Finally, the numbers of OPCs, evaluated with the markers Tcf4 and Olig2, were increased from day 2 (Olig2) or day 7 (Tcf4) post-injury (P~{$\leq~$}0.05). Our results indicate that TBI induces oligodendrocyte apoptosis and widespread myelin loss, followed by a concomitant increase in the number of OPCs. Prevention of myelin loss and oligodendrocyte death may represent novel therapeutic targets for TBI.},

  abstract = {Since the first measurements of neuronal avalanches, the critical brain hypothesis has gained traction. However, if the brain is critical, what is the phase transition? For several decades, it has been known that the cerebral cortex operates in a diversity of regimes, ranging from highly synchronous states (with higher spiking variability) to desynchronized states (with lower spiking variability). Here, using both new and publicly available data, we test independent signatures of criticality and show that a phase transition occurs in an intermediate value of spiking variability, in both anesthetized and freely moving animals. The critical exponents point to a universality class different from mean-field directed percolation. Importantly, as the cortex hovers around this critical point, the avalanche exponents follow a linear relation that encompasses previous experimental results from different setups and is reproduced by a model.},

MRI can differentiate lesion stages in the LPC model and may be useful in investigating mechanistic aspects of the demyelinating process.

  abstract = {Changes in conduction properties and in morphology were studied during rat optic nerve growth from birth (when no myelin is present and the glia have not differentiated) to adulthood (when the optic nerve is essentially 100\% myelinated). Myelination begins around the sixth postnatal day and proceeds rapidly so that 85\% of the fibers are myelinated at 28 days of age. Mean diameter of optic nerve axons remains about 0.2 micron for the first week and then increases rapidly if the fiber is being myelinated. Those axons not being myelinated remain about 0.2-0.3 micron in diameter. At birth the compound action potential has a single negative peak and a conduction velocity of about 0.2 m/s. The increase in conduction velocity prior to myelination is considerably greater than can be accounted for on the basis of increase in axonal diameter. There is no clear step increase in the velocity of the shortest latency peak correlated with the onset of myelination. During myelination the compound action potential develops multiple short latency components, which evolve into the adult-like 3 component compound action potential by 3-4 weeks of age. Durations of the relative refractory period and supernormal period decrease as age increases, but are not related to myelination in a simple manner. Sodium appears to be the only significant carrier of inward current at all ages. A measureable calcium conductance is not present at any age. Voltage-dependent potassium conductance contributes to the compound action potential at all ages, but the response to 4-aminopyridine in rapidly conducting fibers is apparently smaller than that in slowly conducting fibers. These results show that conduction can occur before myelination or the differentiation of glial cells. Moreover, changes in conduction velocity do not depend entirely on myelination or increases in axonal size. Finally, these results suggest a reorganization of axonal membrane properties during the development of rat optic nerve.},

Their effect on MRI-based measurements of cerebral oxygen levels with quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) is not known.                                         Purpose               This study investigated whether wearing a face mask leads to changes in CBF and cerebral venous oxygen saturation measured with MRI.                                         Study Type               Repeated-measures cohort study.                                         Population               A total of 16 healthy volunteers (eight male, eight female; 22--36\,years) were recruited for the 3-ply study. Ten of the 16 participants (five male, five female; 23--36\,years) took part in the KN95 study.                                         Field Strength/Sequence               A 3\,T, single-delay 3D gradient-and spin-echo pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) scan for CBF quantification, and gradient-echo for QSM and oxygenation quantification.                                         Assessment                                Gray matter CBF and magnetic susceptibility were assessed by masking the pCASL CBF map and the QSM map to the T                 1                 -weighted gray matter tissue segmentation. Venous oxygenation was determined from venous segmentation of QSM maximum intensity projections.                                                        Statistical Tests                                Paired Student's                 t                 -tests and Cohen's d effect sizes were used to compare the face mask and no face mask scans for gray matter CBF, gray matter magnetic susceptibility, and cerebral venous oxygen saturation. Standard                 t                 -tests were used to assess whether the order of scanning with and without a mask had any impact. A statistical cut off of                 P                 ~{$<$}\,0.05 was used.                                                        Results                                The 3-ply masks increased gray matter CBF from an average of 43.99\,mL/(100\,g*min) to 46.81\,mL/(100\,g*min). There were no significant changes in gray matter magnetic susceptibility (                 P                 ~=~0.07), or cerebral venous oxygen saturation (                 P                 ~=~0.36) for the 3-ply data set. The KN95 masks data set showed no statistically significant changes in gray matter CBF (                 P                 ~=~0.52) and magnetic susceptibility (                 P                 ~=~0.97), or cerebral venous oxygen saturation (                 P                 ~=~0.93).

  abstract = {Abstract             Recent work has demonstrated that the relationship between structural and functional connectivity varies regionally across the human brain, with reduced coupling emerging along the sensory-association cortical hierarchy. The biological underpinnings driving this expression, however, remain largely unknown. Here, we postulate that intracortical myelination and excitation-inhibition (EI) balance mediate the heterogeneous expression of structure-function coupling (SFC) and its temporal variance across the cortical hierarchy. We employ atlas- and voxel-based connectivity approaches to analyze neuroimaging data acquired from two groups of healthy participants. Our findings are consistent across six complementary processing pipelines: 1) SFC and its temporal variance respectively decrease and increase across the unimodal-transmodal and granular-agranular gradients; 2) increased myelination and lower EI-ratio are associated with more rigid SFC and restricted moment-to-moment SFC fluctuations; 3) a gradual shift from EI-ratio to myelination as the principal predictor of SFC occurs when traversing from granular to agranular cortical regions. Collectively, our work delivers a framework to conceptualize structure-function relationships in the human brain, paving the way for an improved understanding of how demyelination and/or EI-imbalances induce reorganization in brain disorders.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows slight spatial variations in brain white matter (WM). We used quantitative multi-parametric MRI to evaluate in what respect these inhomogeneities could correspond to WM subtypes with specific characteristics and spatial distribution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six controls (12 women, 38 \textpm 9 Y) took part in a 60-min session on a 3T scanner measuring 7 parameters: R1 and R2, diffusion tensor imaging which allowed to measure Axial and Radial Diffusivity (AD, RD), magnetization transfer imaging which enabled to compute the Macromolecular Proton Fraction (MPF), and a susceptibility-weighted sequence which permitted to quantify R2* and magnetic susceptibility ({$\chi$}m). Spatial independent component analysis was used to identify WM subtypes with specific combination of quantitative parameters values. RESULTS: Three subtypes could be identified. t-WM (track) mostly mapped on well-formed projection and commissural tracts and came with high AD values (all p {$<$} 10-18). The two other subtypes were located in subcortical WM and overlapped with association fibers: f-WM (frontal) was mostly anterior in the frontal lobe whereas c-WM (central) was underneath the central cortex. f-WM and c-WM had higher MPF values, indicating a higher myelin content (all p {$<$} 1.7 10-6). This was compatible with their larger {$\chi$}m and R2, as iron is essentially stored in oligodendrocytes (all p {$<$} 0.01). Although R1 essentially showed the same, its higher value in t-WM relative to c-WM might be related to its higher cholesterol concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, f- and c-WMs were less structured, but more myelinated and probably more metabolically active regarding to their iron content than WM related to fasciculi (t-WM). As known WM bundles passed though different WM subtypes, myelination might not be uniform along the axons but rather follow a spatially consistent regional variability. Future studies might examine the reproducibility of this decomposition and how development and pathology differently affect each subtype.},

Regional uncoupling of CBF and CMRO2 was found, however, during neuronal activation induced by somatosensory stimulation. Stimulus-induced focal augmentation of cerebral blood flow (29\% mean) far exceeded the concomitant local increase in tissue metabolic rate (mean, 5\%), when resting-state and stimulated-state measurements were obtained in each of 9 subjects. Stimulus duration had no significant effect on response magnitude or on the degree of CBF-CMRO2 uncoupling observed. Dynamic, physiological regulation of CBF by a mechanism (neuronal or biochemical) dependent on neuronal firing per se, but independent of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, is hypothesized.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To overcome the limitations of conventional diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging resulting from the assumption of a Gaussian diffusion model for characterizing voxels containing multiple axonal orientations, Shannon's entropy was employed to evaluate white matter structure in human brain and in brain remodeling after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in a rat. METHODS: Thirteen healthy subjects were investigated using a Q-ball based DTI data sampling scheme. FA and entropy values were measured in white matter bundles, white matter fiber crossing areas, different gray matter (GM) regions and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Axonal densities' from the same regions of interest (ROIs) were evaluated in Bielschowsky and Luxol fast blue stained autopsy (n = 30) brain sections by light microscopy. As a case demonstration, a Wistar rat subjected to TBI and treated with bone marrow stromal cells (MSC) 1 week after TBI was employed to illustrate the superior ability of entropy over FA in detecting reorganized crossing axonal bundles as confirmed by histological analysis with Bielschowsky and Luxol fast blue staining. RESULTS: Unlike FA, entropy was less affected by axonal orientation and more affected by axonal density. A significant agreement (r = 0.91) was detected between entropy values from in vivo human brain and histologically measured axonal density from post mortum from the same brain structures. The MSC treated TBI rat demonstrated that the entropy approach is superior to FA in detecting axonal remodeling after injury. Compared with FA, entropy detected new axonal remodeling regions with crossing axons, confirmed with immunohistological staining. CONCLUSIONS: Entropy measurement is more effective in distinguishing axonal remodeling after injury, when compared with FA. Entropy is also more sensitive to axonal density than axonal orientation, and thus may provide a more accurate reflection of axonal changes that occur in neurological injury and disease.},

Features of brain dynamics have been linked to emotion and cognition in adult individuals, and atypical patterns have been associated with neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism. Although reliable functional brain networks have been consistently identified in neonates, little is known about the early development of dynamic functional connectivity. In this study we characterise dynamic functional connectivity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the first few weeks of postnatal life in term-born (n\,=\,324) and preterm-born (n\,=\,66) individuals. We show that a dynamic landscape of brain connectivity is already established by the time of birth in the human brain, characterised by six transient states of neonatal functional connectivity with changing dynamics through the neonatal period. The pattern of dynamic connectivity is atypical in preterm-born infants, and associated with atypical social, sensory, and repetitive behaviours measured by the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT) scores at 18 months of age.},

  abstract = {Remyelination involves reinvesting demyelinated axons with new myelin sheaths. In stark contrast to the situation that follows loss of neurons or axonal damage, remyelination in the CNS can be a highly effective regenerative process. It is mediated by a population of precursor cells called oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which are widely distributed throughout the adult CNS. However, despite its efficiency in experimental models and in some clinical diseases, remyelination is often inadequate in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common demyelinating disease and a cause of neurological disability in young adults. The failure of remyelination has profound consequences for the health of axons, the progressive and irreversible loss of which accounts for the progressive nature of these diseases. The mechanisms of remyelination therefore provide critical clues for regeneration biologists that help them to determine why remyelination fails in MS and in other demyelinating diseases and how it might be enhanced therapeutically.},

However, the route to adult patterns of resting-state activity through neuronal development in the human brain is currently unknown. Therefore, we used functional MRI to map patterns of resting-state activity in infants during sleep. We found five unique resting-states networks in the infant brain that encompassed the primary visual cortex, bilateral sensorimotor areas, bilateral auditory cortex, a network including the precuneus area, lateral parietal cortex, and the cerebellum as well as an anterior network that incorporated the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that resting-state networks driven by spontaneous signal fluctuations are present already in the infant brain. The potential link between the emergence of behavior and patterns of resting-state activity in the infant brain is discussed.},

Despite this optimistic trend, preterm birth rates remain higher in the USA, where nearly one in every eight infants is born early, compared to other developed countries. The prevention of preterm birth is considered a public health priority because of the potential to reduce infant and childhood morbidity and mortality related to this condition. Unfortunately, progress has been modest. One of the greatest challenges in studying this outcome is that preterm birth is a complex condition resulting from multiple etiologic pathways. Recently, experts have developed innovative frameworks for classifying and studying preterm birth based on phenotype. These proposed classification systems have only recently been adopted, but a different perspective on a longstanding problem has the potential to lead to new discoveries.},

We analyze neuronal network data collected at the individual neuron level using the framework of nonequilibrium phase transitions. Among the most striking predictions confirmed is that the mean temporal profiles of avalanches of widely varying durations are quantitatively described by a single universal scaling function. We also show that the data have three additional features predicted by critical phenomena: approximate power law distributions of avalanche sizes and durations, samples in subcritical and supercritical phases, and scaling laws between anomalous exponents.},

Most notably, in cortical gray matter, strong contrast variations have been observed that appear to reflect the local laminar architecture. This contrast has been attributed to subtle variations in the magnetic properties of brain tissue, possibly reflecting varying iron and myelin content. To establish the origin of this contrast, MRI data from postmortem brain samples were compared with electron microscopy and histological staining for iron and myelin. The results show that iron is distributed over laminae in a pattern that is suggestive of each region's myeloarchitecture and forms the dominant source of the observed MRI contrast.},

  abstract = {Children surviving preterm birth have a high risk of disability, particularly cognitive and learning problems. There is extensive clinical and experimental evidence that disability is now primarily related to dysmaturation of white and gray matter, defined by failure of oligodendrocyte maturation and neuronal dendritic arborization, rather than cell death alone. The etiology of this dysmaturation is multifactorial, with contributions from hypoxia-ischemia, infection/inflammation and barotrauma. Intriguingly, these factors can interact to both increase and decrease damage. In this review we summarize preclinical and clinical evidence that all of these factors trigger secondary or chronic inflammation and gliosis. Thus, we hypothesize that these shared pathological features play a key role in a final common pathway that leads to the impaired neural maturation and connectivity and cognitive/motor impairments that are commonly observed in infants born preterm. This raises the possibility that secondary or chronic inflammation may be a viable therapeutic target for delayed interventions to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes after preterm birth.

  abstract = {Despite recent advancements in MR imaging, non-invasive mapping of myelin in the brain still remains an open issue. Here we attempted to provide a potential solution. Specifically, we developed a processing workflow based on T1-w and T2-w MR data to generate an optimized myelin enhanced contrast image. The workflow allows whole brain mapping using the T1-w/T2-w technique, which was originally introduced as a non-invasive method for assessing cortical myelin content. The hallmark of our approach is a retrospective calibration algorithm, applied to bias-corrected T1-w and T2-w images, that relies on image intensities outside the brain. This permits standardizing the intensity histogram of the ratio image, thereby allowing for across-subject statistical analyses. Quantitative comparisons of image histograms within and across different datasets confirmed the effectiveness of our normalization procedure. Not only did the calibrated T1-w/T2-w images exhibit a comparable intensity range, but also the shape of the intensity histograms was largely corresponding. We also assessed the reliability and specificity of the ratio image compared to other MR-based techniques, such as magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), fractional anisotropy (FA), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). With respect to these other techniques, T1-w/T2-w had consistently high values, as well as low inter-subject variability, in brain structures where myelin is most abundant. Overall, our results suggested that the T1-w/T2-w technique may be a valid tool supporting the non-invasive mapping of myelin in the brain. Therefore, it might find important applications in the study of brain development, aging and disease.},

  abstract = {Infancy is a critical and immensely important period in human brain development. Subtle changes during this stage may be greatly amplified with the unfolding of different developmental processes, exerting far-reaching consequences. Studies of the structure and behavioral manifestations of the infant brain are fruitful. However, the specific functional brain mechanisms that enable the execution of different behaviors remained elusive until the advent of functional connectivity fMRI (fcMRI), which provides an unprecedented opportunity to probe the infant functional brain development in vivo. Since its inception, a burgeoning field of infant brain functional connectivity study has emerged and thrived during the past decade. In this review, we describe (1) findings of normal development of functional connectivity networks and their relationships to behaviors and (2) disruptions of the normative functional connectivity development due to identifiable genetic and/or environmental risk factors during the first 2 years of human life. Technical considerations of infant fcMRI are also provided. It is our hope to consolidate previous findings so that the field can move forward with a clearer picture toward the ultimate goal of fcMRI-based objective methods for early diagnosis/identification of risks and evaluation of early interventions to optimize developing functional connectivity networks in this critical developmental window.},

  abstract = {Magnetization transfer and multicomponent T2 imaging techniques were implemented to study guinea pig in vivo. A chronic-progressive model of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) was produced, and the inflammatory component of the disease was manipulated using antibodies against integrin. The magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) and T2 relaxation properties were measured in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) with histological comparisons. Significant reductions in both the mean MTR and the myelin water percentage were measured in NAWM of EAE guinea pig brain. However, the MTR and myelin water percentage appear to measure different aspects of pathology in NAWM in EAE. Reductions in the MTR were prevented or reversed with suppression of inflammation. However, modulation of inflammatory activity was not reflected in the measurement of the myelin water percentage. Since the amount of myelin is not expected to vary with inflammatory-related changes, these observations support our hypothesis that the MTR is sensitive to physiological changes to myelin induced by inflammation, while the short T2 component is a more specific indicator of myelin content in tissue. Pathologic features other than demyelination may be important in the determination of the MTR.},

  abstract = {Modulation of interactions among neurons can manifest as dramatic changes in the state of population dynamics in cerebral cortex. How such transitions in cortical state impact the information processing performed by cortical circuits is not clear. Here we performed experiments and computational modeling to determine how somatosensory dynamic range depends on cortical state. We used microelectrode arrays to record ongoing and whisker stimulus-evoked population spiking activity in somatosensory cortex of urethane anesthetized rats. We observed a continuum of different cortical states; at one extreme population activity exhibited small scale variability and was weakly correlated, the other extreme had large scale fluctuations and strong correlations. In experiments, shifts along the continuum often occurred naturally, without direct manipulation. In addition, in both the experiment and the model we directly tuned the cortical state by manipulating inhibitory synaptic interactions. Our principal finding was that somatosensory dynamic range was maximized in a specific cortical state, called criticality, near the tipping point midway between the ends of the continuum. The optimal cortical state was uniquely characterized by scale-free ongoing population dynamics and moderate correlations, in line with theoretical predictions about criticality. However, to reproduce our experimental findings, we found that existing theory required modifications which account for activity-dependent depression. In conclusion, our experiments indicate that in vivo sensory dynamic range is maximized near criticality and our model revealed an unanticipated role for activity-dependent depression in this basic principle of cortical function.},

  abstract = {Traumatic coma was produced in 45 monkeys by accelerating the head without impact in one of three directions. The duration of coma, degree of neurological impairment, and amount of diffuse axonal injury (DAI) in the brain were directly related to the amount of coronal head motion used. Coma of less than 15 minutes (concussion) occurred in 11 of 13 animals subjected to sagittal head motion, in 2 of 6 animals with oblique head motion, and in 2 of 26 animals with full lateral head motion. All 15 concussioned animals had good recovery, and none had DAI. Conversely, coma lasting more than 6 hours occurred in one of the sagittal or oblique injury groups but was present in 20 of the laterally injured animals, all of which were severely disabled afterward. All laterally injured animals had a degree of DAI similar to that found in severe human head injury. Coma lasting 16 minutes to 6 hours occurred in 2 of 13 of the sagittal group, 4 of 6 in the oblique group, and 4 of 26 in the lateral group, these animals had less neurological disability and less DAI than when coma lasted longer than 6 hours. These experimental findings duplicate the spectrum of traumatic coma seen in human beings and include axonal damage identical to that seen in sever head injury in humans. Since the amount of DAI was directly proportional to the severity of injury (duration of coma and quality of outcome), we conclude that axonal damage produced by coronal head acceleration is a major cause of prolonged traumatic coma and its sequelae.},

Method               In this retrospective data analysis we included all surviving infants born preterm with a gestational age between 23 and 32\,weeks from 2011 to 2015, who were assessed using the Neonatal Pain, Agitation, and Sedation Scale and examined at 1\,year of age using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development.

T1-weighted sequences are used for the "premyelination" process and T2-weighted sequences for myelination proper. The development of myelination in the white matter is sequential, precisely determined, identical in all individuals, and it has been well studied by histologists. In vivo, myelination in infants is shown at MRI as the same precise sequence but with some changes in time towards the end. The myelination process takes place at different times and different speeds in different brain regions, and for any given structure the speed of myelination varies in relation to time.},

DATA SOURCES: Over 100 articles from both basic science and clinical medical literature selected for relevance to concussive brain injury, postinjury pathophysiology, and recovery of function. DATA SYNTHESIS: The primary elements of the pathophysiologic cascade following concussive brain injury include abrupt neuronal depolarization, release of excitatory neurotransmitters, ionic shifts, changes in glucose metabolism, altered cerebral blood flow, and impaired axonal function. These alterations can be correlated with periods of postconcussion vulnerability and with neurobehavioral abnormalities. While the time course of these changes is well understood in experimental animal models, it is only beginning to be characterized following human concussion. CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS: Following concussion, cerebral pathophysiology can be adversely affected for days in animals and weeks in humans. Significant changes in cerebral glucose metabolism can exist even in head-injured patients with normal Glasgow Coma Scores, underscoring the need for in-depth clinical assessment in an effort to uncover neurocognitive correlates of altered cerebral physiology. Improved guidelines for clinical management of concussion may be formulated as the functional significance and duration of these postinjury neurometabolic derangements are better delineated.},

The initial ionic flux and glutamate release result in significant energy demands and a period of metabolic crisis for the injured brain. These physiological perturbations can now be linked to clinical characteristics of concussion, including migrainous symptoms, vulnerability to repeat injury, and cognitive impairment. Furthermore, advanced neuroimaging now allows a research window to monitor postconcussion pathophysiology in humans noninvasively. There is also increasing concern about the risk for chronic or even progressive neurobehavioral impairment after concussion/mild traumatic brain injury. Critical studies are underway to better link the acute pathobiology of concussion with potential mechanisms of chronic cell death, dysfunction, and neurodegeneration. This "new and improved" article summarizes in a translational fashion and updates what is known about the acute neurometabolic changes after concussive brain injury. Furthermore, new connections are proposed between this neurobiology and early clinical symptoms as well as to cellular processes that may underlie long-term impairment.},

We present a new method of mapping cortical areas based on myelin content as revealed by T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) MRI. The method is generalizable across different 3T scanners and pulse sequences. We use the ratio of T1w/T2w image intensities to eliminate the MR-related image intensity bias and enhance the contrast to noise ratio for myelin. Data from each subject were mapped to the cortical surface and aligned across individuals using surface-based registration. The spatial gradient of the group average myelin map provides an observer-independent measure of sharp transitions in myelin content across the surface--i.e., putative cortical areal borders. We found excellent agreement between the gradients of the myelin maps and the gradients of published probabilistic cytoarchitectonically defined cortical areas that were registered to the same surface-based atlas. For other cortical regions, we used published anatomical and functional information to make putative identifications of dozens of cortical areas or candidate areas. In general, primary and early unimodal association cortices are heavily myelinated and higher, multimodal, association cortices are more lightly myelinated, but there are notable exceptions in the literature that are confirmed by our results. The overall pattern in the myelin maps also has important correlations with the developmental onset of subcortical white matter myelination, evolutionary cortical areal expansion in humans compared with macaques, postnatal cortical expansion in humans, and maps of neuronal density in non-human primates.},

We review recent in vivo myelin mapping studies and discuss some of the different methods for estimating myelin content. We discuss some ways in which myelin maps may improve surface registration and be useful for cross-modal and cross-species comparisons, including some preliminary cross-species results. Next, we consider neurobiological aspects of why some parts of cortex are more myelinated than others. Myelin content is inversely correlated with intracortical circuit complexity - in general, more myelin content means simpler and perhaps less dynamic intracortical circuits. Using existing PET data and functional network parcellations, we examine metabolic differences in the differently myelinated cortical functional networks. Lightly myelinated cognitive association networks tend to have higher aerobic glycolysis than heavily myelinated early sensory-motor ones, perhaps reflecting greater ongoing dynamic anabolic cortical processes. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that intracortical myelination may stabilize intracortical circuits and inhibit synaptic plasticity. Finally, we discuss the future of the in vivo myeloarchitectural field and cortical parcellation--"in vivo Brodmann mapping"--in general.},

  abstract = {Premature birth is a significant cause of infant and child morbidity and mortality. In the United States, the premature birth rate, which had steadily increased during the 1990s and early 2000s, has decreased annually for 7 years and is now approximately 11.39\%. Human viability, defined as gestational age at which the chance of survival is 50\%, is currently approximately 23 to 24 weeks in developed countries. Infant girls, on average, have better outcomes than infant boys. A relatively uncomplicated course in the intensive care nursery for an extremely premature infant results in a discharge date close to the prenatal estimated date of confinement. Despite technological advances and efforts of child health experts during the last generation, the extremely premature infant (less than 28 weeks gestation) and extremely low birth weight infant ({$<$}1000 g) remain at high risk for death and disability with 30\% to 50\% mortality and, in survivors, at least 20\% to 50\% risk of morbidity. The introduction of continuous positive airway pressure, mechanical ventilation, and exogenous surfactant increased survival and spurred the development of neonatal intensive care in the 1970s through the early 1990s. Routine administration of antenatal steroids during premature labor improved neonatal mortality and morbidity in the late 1990s. The recognition that chronic postnatal administration of steroids to infants should be avoided may have improved outcomes in the early 2000s. Evidence from recent trials attempting to define the appropriate target for oxygen saturation in preterm infants suggests arterial oxygen saturation between 91\% and 95\% (compared with 85\%-89\%) avoids excess mortality; however, final analyses of data from these trials have not been published, so definitive recommendations are still pending. The development of neonatal neurocritical intensive care units may improve neurocognitive outcomes in this high-risk group. Long-term follow-up to detect and address developmental, learning, behavioral, and social problems is critical for children born at these early gestational ages.The striking similarities in response to extreme prematurity in the lung and brain imply that agents and techniques that benefit one organ are likely to also benefit the other. Finally, because therapy and supportive care continue to change, the outcomes of extremely low birth weight infants are ever evolving. Efforts to minimize injury, preserve growth, and identify interventions focused on antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways are now being evaluated. Thus, treating and preventing long-term deficits must be developed in the context of a "moving target."},

Proton MR spectroscopy images were obtained with the multivoxel chemical-shift imaging mode (TR=1500ms, TE=40ms). Spectra from 224 voxels in the brain parenchyma were studied.  N -acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho), and myoinositol (mI) peaks were quantitatively evaluated, and NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, and Cho/Cr, mI/Cr ratios were calculated. Five age-matched normal cases were available as controls. In three patients with Rett syndrome spectroscopy findings were normal, and the metabolite ratios were similar to control cases. In the remaining four patients with the syndrome prominent decrease of the NAA peak was the main finding resulting in decreases in NAA/Cr (1.14\textpm 17), and NAA/Cho (1.08\textpm 27) ratios ( p},

  abstract = {Beta amyloid is a protein fragment snipped from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Aggregation of these peptides into amyloid plaques is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. MR imaging of beta amyloid plaques has been attempted using various techniques, notably with T2* contrast. The non-invasive detectability of beta amyloid plaques in MR images has so far been largely attributed to focal iron deposition accompanying the plaques. It is believed that the T2* shortening effects of paramagnetic iron are the primary source of contrast between plaques and surrounding tissue. Amyloid plaque itself has been reported to induce no magnetic susceptibility effect. We hypothesized that aggregations of beta amyloid would increase electron density and induce notable changes in local susceptibility value, large enough to generate contrast relative to surrounding normal tissues that can be visualized by quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) MR imaging. To test this hypothesis, we first demonstrated in a phantom that beta amyloid is diamagnetic and can generate strong contrast on susceptibility maps. We then conducted experiments on a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease that is known to mimic the formation of human beta amyloid but without neurofibrillary tangles or neuronal death. Over a period of 18 months, we showed that QSM can be used to longitudinally monitor beta amyloid accumulation and accompanied iron deposition in vivo. Individual beta amyloid plaque can also be visualized ex vivo in high resolution susceptibility maps. Moreover, the measured negative susceptibility map and positive susceptibility map could provide histology-like image contrast for identifying deposition of beta amyloid plaques and iron. Finally, we demonstrated that the diamagnetic susceptibility of beta amyloid can also be observed in brain specimens of AD patients. The ability to assess beta amyloid aggregation non-invasively with QSM MR imaging may aid the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.},

In individuals, we consistently found nine subnetworks within the Default network. These subnetworks matched brain activity patterns during cognitive tasks.

Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

  abstract = {Objective Cerebral venous oxygenation (Yv) is a key parameter for the brain's oxygen utilization and has been suggested to be a valuable biomarker in various brain diseases including hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy in neonates and Alzheimer's disease in older adults. T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST) MRI is a widely used technique to measure global Yv level and has been validated against gold-standard PET. However, subject motion during TRUST MRI scan can introduce considerable errors in Yv quantification, especially for noncompliant subjects. The aim of this study was to develop an Automatic Rejection based on Tissue Signal (ARTS) algorithm for automatic detection and exclusion of motion-contaminated images to improve the precision of Yv quantification. Methods TRUST MRI data were collected from a neonatal cohort (N~=~37, 16 females, gestational age~=~39.12~\textpm ~1.11~weeks, postnatal age~=~1.89~\textpm ~0.74~days) and an older adult cohort (N~=~223, 134 females, age~=~68.02~\textpm ~9.01~years). Manual identification of motion-corrupted images was conducted for both cohorts to serve as a gold-standard. 9.3\% of the images in the neonatal datasets and 0.4\% of the images in the older adult datasets were manually identified as motion-contaminated. The ARTS algorithm was trained using the neonatal datasets. TRUST Yv values, as well as the estimation uncertainty ({$\Delta$}R2) and test-retest coefficient-of-variation (CoV) of Yv, were calculated with and without ARTS motion exclusion. The ARTS algorithm was tested on datasets of older adults: first on the original adult datasets with little motion, and then on simulated adult datasets where the percentage of motion-corrupted images matched that of the neonatal datasets. Results In the neonatal datasets, the ARTS algorithm exhibited a sensitivity of 0.95 and a specificity of 0.97 in detecting motion-contaminated images. Compared to no motion exclusion, ARTS significantly reduced the {$\Delta$}R2 (median~=~3.68~Hz vs. 4.89~Hz, P~=~0.0002) and CoV (median~=~2.57\% vs. 6.87\%, P~=~0.0005) of Yv measurements. In the original older adult datasets, the sensitivity and specificity of ARTS were 0.70 and 1.00, respectively. In the simulated adult datasets, ARTS demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.91 and a specificity of 1.00. Additionally, ARTS significantly reduced the {$\Delta$}R2 compared to no motion exclusion (median~=~2.15~Hz vs. 3.54~Hz, P~{$<~$}0.0001). Conclusion ARTS can improve the reliability of Yv estimation in noncompliant subjects, which may enhance the utility of Yv as a biomarker for brain diseases.},

OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of an oral sucrose solution vs. placebo in alleviating pain in children (1-3~months) during nasopharyngeal aspiration (NPA). METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial was conducted in a pediatric hospital emergency department. Participants (aged 1-3~months) requiring NPA were randomly allocated to receive 2~mL of 88\% sucrose (SUC) or 2~mL of a placebo (PLA) 2~min prior to the procedure. The primary outcome was the mean difference in pain scores at 1~min post NPA as assessed by the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability (FLACC) Pain Scale. RESULTS: Seventy-two participants completed the study, 37 receiving SUC and 35 PLA. The mean difference in FLACC scores compared with baseline was 3.3 (2.5-4.1) for SUC vs. 3.2 (2.3-4.1) for PLA (p~=~.094) at 1~min and -1.2 (-1.7-0.7) for SUC vs. -0.8 (-1.5 to -0.1) for PLA (p~=~0.66) at 3~min after NPA. For the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale scores, it was 2.3 (1.6-3.0) (SUC) vs. 2.5 (1.8-3.2) (PLA) (p~=~.086) at 1~min and -1.2 (-1.6 to -0.8) (SUC) vs. -0.8 (-1.3 to 0.2) (PLA) (p~=~0.59) 3~min after NPA. There was no difference in the mean crying time, 114 (98-130) s, SUC vs. 109 (92-126) s, PLA (p~=~0.81). No significant difference was found in participants' heart rate at 1~min 174 (154-194) beats/min in SUC vs. 179 (160-198) beats/min in PLA (p~=~0.32). CONCLUSIONS: In infants (1-3~months) undergoing NPA, administration of an oral sweet solution did not statistically decrease pain scores.},

All these methods are tested and compared on several ARX, Poisson and nonlinear models, and on neurophysiological data (depth EEG). The results show that LGC, DCOH and PDC are not very robust in relation to nonlinear linkages but they seem to correctly find linear linkages if only the autoregressive parts are nonlinear. PNGC is extremely dependent on the choice of parameters. Moreover, LGC and PNGC may give misleading results in the case of causality on a spectral band, which is illustrated by our neurophysiological database.},

  abstract = {The identification of resting state networks (RSNs) and the quantification of their functional connectivity in resting-state fMRI (rfMRI) are seriously hindered by the presence of artefacts, many of which overlap spatially or spectrally with RSNs. Moreover, recent developments in fMRI acquisition yield data with higher spatial and temporal resolutions, but may increase artefacts both spatially and/or temporally. Hence the correct identification and removal of non-neural fluctuations is crucial, especially in accelerated acquisitions. In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of three data-driven cleaning procedures, compare standard against higher (spatial and temporal) resolution accelerated fMRI acquisitions, and investigate the combined effect of different acquisitions and different cleanup approaches. We applied single-subject independent component analysis (ICA), followed by automatic component classification with FMRIB's ICA-based X-noiseifier (FIX) to identify artefactual components. We then compared two first-level (within-subject) cleaning approaches for removing those artefacts and motion-related fluctuations from the data. The effectiveness of the cleaning procedures was assessed using time series (amplitude and spectra), network matrix and spatial map analyses. For time series and network analyses we also tested the effect of a second-level cleaning (informed by group-level analysis). Comparing these approaches, the preferable balance between noise removal and signal loss was achieved by regressing out of the data the full space of motion-related fluctuations and only the unique variance of the artefactual ICA components. Using similar analyses, we also investigated the effects of different cleaning approaches on data from different acquisition sequences. With the optimal cleaning procedures, functional connectivity results from accelerated data were statistically comparable or significantly better than the standard (unaccelerated) acquisition, and, crucially, with higher spatial and temporal resolution. Moreover, we were able to perform higher dimensionality ICA decompositions with the accelerated data, which is very valuable for detailed network analyses.},

  abstract = {Effects of early life psychosocial adversity have received a great deal of attention, such as maternal separation in experimental animal models and abuse/neglect in young humans. More recently, long-term effects of the physical stress of repetitive procedural pain have begun to be addressed in infants hospitalized in neonatal intensive care. Preterm infants are more sensitive to pain and stress, which cannot be distinguished in neonates. The focus of this review is clinical studies of long-term effects of repeated procedural pain-related stress in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in relation to brain development, neurodevelopment, programming of stress systems, and later pain sensitivity in infants born very preterm (24-32 weeks' gestational age). Neonatal pain exposure has been quantified as the number of invasive and/or skin-breaking procedures during hospitalization in the NICU. Emerging studies provide convincing clinical evidence for an adverse impact of neonatal pain/stress in infants at a time of physiological immaturity, rapidly developing brain microstructure and networks, as well as programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Currently it appears that early pain/stress may influence the developing brain and thereby neurodevelopment and stress-sensitive behaviors, particularly in the most immature neonates. However, there is no evidence for greater prevalence of pain syndromes compared to children and adults born healthy at full term. In addressing associations between pain/stress and outcomes, careful consideration of confounding clinical factors related to prematurity is essential. The need for pain management for humanitarian care is widely advocated. Non-pharmacological interventions to help parents reduce their infant's stress may be brain-protective.},

ADNI is a large multicenter study with each center having its own copy of the phantom. The design of the phantom and analysis software are presented as results from predistribution systematics studies and results from field experience with the phantom at 58 enrolling ADNI sites over a 3 year period. The estimated coefficients of variation intrinsic to measurements of geometry in a single phantom are in the range of 3-5 parts in 10(4). Phantom measurements accurately detect linear and nonlinear scaling in images. Gradient unwarping methods are readily assessed by phantom nonlinearity measurements. Phantom-based scaling correction reduces observed geometric drift in human images by one-third or more. Repair or replacement of phantoms between scans, however, is a confounding factor. The ADNI phantom can be used to assess both scanner performance and the validity of postprocessing image corrections in order to reduce systematic errors in human images. Reduced measurement errors should decrease measurement bias and increase statistical power for measurements of rates of change in the brain structure in AD treatment trials. Perhaps the greatest practical value of incorporating ADNI phantom measurements in a multisite study is to identify scanner errors through central monitoring. This approach has resulted in identification of system errors including sites misidentification of their own gradient hardware and the disabling of autoshim, and a miscalibrated laser alignment light. If undetected, these errors would have contributed to imprecision in quantitative metrics at over 25\% of all enrolling ADNI sites.},

Players injured with a concussion were monitored until their concussion symptoms resolved and were followed up for repeat concussions until completion of their collegiate football career or until the end of the 2001 football season.Main Outcome Measures~Incidence of concussion and repeat concusion; type and duration of symptoms and course of recovery among players who were injured with a concussion during the seasons.Results~During follow-up of 4251 player-seasons, 184 players (6.3\%) had a concussion, and 12 (6.5\%) of these players had a repeat concussion within the same season. There was an association between reported number of previous concussions and likelihood of incident concussion. Players reporting a history of 3 or more previous concussions were 3.0 (95\% confidence interval, 1.6-5.6) times more likely to have an incident concussion than players with no concussion history. Headache was the most commonly reported symptom at the time of injury (85.2\%), and mean overall symptom duration was 82 hours. Slowed recovery was associated with a history of multiple previous concussions (30.0\% of those with {$\geq$}3 previous concussions had symptoms lasting {$>$}1 week compared with 14.6\% of those with 1 previous concussion). Of the 12 incident within-season repeat concussions, 11 (91.7\%) occurred within 10 days of the first injury, and 9 (75.0\%) occurred within 7 days of the first injury.Conclusions~Our study suggests that players with a history of previous concussions are more likely to have future concussive injuries than those with no history; 1 in 15 players with a concussion may have additional concussions in the same playing season; and previous concussions may be associated with slower recovery of neurological function.},

  abstract = {From toddler to late teenager, the macroscopic pattern of axonal projections in the human brain remains largely unchanged while undergoing dramatic functional modifications that lead to network refinement. These functional modifications are mediated by increasing myelination and changes in axonal diameter and synaptic density, as well as changes in neurochemical mediators. Here we explore the contribution of white matter maturation to the development of connectivity between ages 2 and 18 y using high b-value diffusion MRI tractography and connectivity analysis. We measured changes in connection efficacy as the inverse of the average diffusivity along a fiber tract. We observed significant refinement in specific metrics of network topology, including a significant increase in node strength and efficiency along with a decrease in clustering. Major structural modules and hubs were in place by 2 y of age, and they continued to strengthen their profile during subsequent development. Recording resting-state functional MRI from a subset of subjects, we confirmed a positive correlation between structural and functional connectivity, and in addition observed that this relationship strengthened with age. Continuously increasing integration and decreasing segregation of structural connectivity with age suggests that network refinement mediated by white matter maturation promotes increased global efficiency. In addition, the strengthening of the correlation between structural and functional connectivity with age suggests that white matter connectivity in combination with other factors, such as differential modulation of axonal diameter and myelin thickness, that are partially captured by inverse average diffusivity, play an increasingly important role in creating brain-wide coherence and synchrony.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by a continuum of symptoms including inattentiveness, hyperfocus, and hyperactivity, that are manifested,             e.g.             , in increased reaction-time variability in continuous performance tasks (CPTs). Framework of brain criticality posits that brains operate in an extended regime of critical-like dynamics where neuronal and behavioral processes exhibit scale-free long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) across hundreds of seconds. Whether shifts across critical-like brain states and parallel changes in LRTCs underlie ADHD symptoms has remained unexplored. We investigated whether brain-state shifts towards excitation-dominated dynamics and associated changes in LRTCs could explain ADHD symptoms and their continuum across individuals. We measured brain activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG) during resting and two CPTs from adult participants diagnosed with ADHD (             N             = 34) and neurotypical controls (NC) (             N             = 36) and characterized criticality with LRTCs of neuronal oscillations. ADHD patients exhibited stronger LRTCs than NC in low (5-20 Hz) and high (30-100 Hz) frequencies and dichotomous task effects. High-frequency LRTCs were positively correlated with ADHD symptoms, while beta-band (20-30 Hz) activity exhibited a quadratic correlation, peaking at moderate scores across the ADHD and NC cohorts being smaller for low and high scores. We demonstrate that ADHD is associated with shifts in brain criticality in resting-and task-state brain dynamics. Individuals with intermediate symptom scores across the NC and ADHD cohorts operated at peak criticality that is associated with a several functional benefits The progressive shift towards the supercritical side of the critical regime becomes detrimental only at moderate and severe symptoms.},

  abstract = {Recent years of research have shown that the complex temporal structure of ongoing oscillations is scale-free and characterized by long-range temporal correlations. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) has proven particularly useful, revealing that genetic variation, normal development, or disease can lead to differences in the scale-free amplitude modulation of oscillations. Furthermore, amplitude dynamics is remarkably independent of the time-averaged oscillation power, indicating that the DFA provides unique insights into the functional organization of neuronal systems. To facilitate understanding and encourage wider use of scaling analysis of neuronal oscillations, we provide a pedagogical explanation of the DFA algorithm and its underlying theory. Practical advice on applying DFA to oscillations is supported by MATLAB scripts from the Neurophysiological Biomarker Toolbox (NBT) and links to the NBT tutorial website http://www.nbtwiki.net/. Finally, we provide a brief overview of insights derived from the application of DFA to ongoing oscillations in health and disease, and discuss the putative relevance of criticality for understanding the mechanism underlying scale-free modulation of oscillations.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Several studies have shown strong correlations between myelin content and T1 within the brain, and have even suggested that T1 can be used to estimate myelin content. However, other micro-anatomical features such as compartment size are known to affect longitudinal relaxation rates, similar to compartment size effects in porous media. METHODS: T1 measurements were compared with measured or otherwise published axon size measurements in white matter tracts of the rat spinal cord, rat brain, and human brain. RESULTS: In both ex vivo and in vivo studies, correlations were present between the relaxation rate 1/T1 and axon size across regions of rat spinal cord with nearly equal myelin content. CONCLUSION: While myelination is likely the dominant determinant of T1 in white matter, variations in white matter microstructure, independent of myelin volume fraction, may also be reflected in T1 differences between regions or subjects.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Susceptibility MR imaging contrast variations reflect alterations in brain iron and myelin content, making this imaging tool relevant to studies of multiple sclerosis lesion heterogeneity. In this study, we aimed to characterize the relationship of high-field, susceptibility contrasts in multiple sclerosis lesions to clinical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four subjects with multiple sclerosis underwent 7T MR imaging of the brain, disability examinations, and a fatigue inventory. The inverse of T2* relaxation time (R2*), frequency, and relative susceptibility (from quantitative susceptibility mapping) were analyzed in 306 white matter lesions. RESULTS: Most lesions were hypointense on R2* (88\% without a rim, 5\% with). Lesions that were hyperintense on quantitative susceptibility mapping were more frequent in relapsing-remitting than in progressive multiple sclerosis (54\% versus 35\%, P = .018). Hyperintense lesion rims on quantitative susceptibility maps were more common in progressive multiple sclerosis and patients with higher levels of disability and fatigue. Mean lesion R2* was inversely related to disability and fatigue and significantly reduced in progressive multiple sclerosis. Relative susceptibility was lower in lesions in progressive multiple sclerosis (median, -0.018 ppm; range, -0.070 to 0.022) than in relapsing-remitting MS (median, -0.010 ppm; range, -0.062 to 0.052; P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: A progressive clinical phenotype and greater disability and fatigue were associated with lower R2* and relative susceptibility values (suggestive of low iron due to oligodendrocyte loss) and rimmed lesions (suggestive of chronic inflammation) in this multiple sclerosis cohort. Lesion heterogeneity on susceptibility MR imaging may help explain disability in multiple sclerosis and provide a window into the processes of demyelination, oligodendrocyte loss, and chronic lesion inflammation.},

The aim of this study was to elucidate the possible abnormalities in benzodiazepine receptor uptake in the brains of patients with mild traumatic brain injury. Nine unmedicated patients with mild traumatic brain injury were investigated using 123I-iomazenil single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). DESIGN: A descriptive study comparing patients after mild traumatic brain injury with matched control subjects. SUBJECTS: Nine patients with mild traumatic brain injury and 5 controls. METHODS: The SPECT scan was taken 180 min after injection of tracer. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: All 9 patients had a significant increase ({$>$} 2 standard deviations higher than the mean of controls) in benzodiazepine receptor uptake in the prefrontal cortex and significantly higher frontal association cortex-to-average global brain activity ratios than in controls. This SPECT study demonstrated focally altered benzodiazepine receptor uptake in the prefrontal cortices in patients with mild traumatic brain injury.},

The NIHTB-CB was designed for use in epidemiologic studies and clinical trials for ages 3 to 85. A total of 268 self-described healthy adults were recruited at four university-based sites, using stratified sampling guidelines to target demographic variability for age (20-85 years), gender, education, and ethnicity. The NIHTB-CB contains seven computer-based instruments assessing five cognitive sub-domains: Language, Executive Function, Episodic Memory, Processing Speed, and Working Memory. Participants completed the NIHTB-CB, corresponding gold standard validation measures selected to tap the same cognitive abilities, and sociodemographic questionnaires. Three Composite Scores were derived for both the NIHTB-CB and gold standard batteries: "Crystallized Cognition Composite," "Fluid Cognition Composite," and "Total Cognition Composite" scores. NIHTB Composite Scores showed acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's alphas=0.84 Crystallized, 0.83 Fluid, 0.77 Total), excellent test-retest reliability (r: 0.86-0.92), strong convergent (r: 0.78-0.90) and discriminant (r: 0.19-0.39) validities versus gold standard composites, and expected age effects (r=0.18 crystallized, r=-0.68 fluid, r=-0.26 total). Significant relationships with self-reported prior school difficulties and current health status, employment, and presence of a disability provided evidence of external validity. The NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery Composite Scores have excellent reliability and validity, suggesting they can be used effectively in epidemiologic and clinical studies.},

  abstract = {Recently reported contrast in phase images of human and animal brains obtained with gradient-recalled echo MRI holds great promise for the in vivo study of biological tissue structure with substantially improved resolution. Herein we investigate the origins of this contrast and demonstrate that it depends on the tissue "magnetic architecture" at the subcellular and cellular levels. This architecture is mostly determined by the structural arrangements of proteins, lipids, non-heme tissue iron, deoxyhemoglobin, and their magnetic susceptibilities. Such magnetic environment affects/shifts magnetic resonance (MR) frequencies of the water molecules moving/diffusing in the tissue. A theoretical framework allowing quantitative evaluation of the corresponding frequency shifts is developed based on the introduced concept of a generalized Lorentzian approximation. It takes into account both tissue architecture and its orientation with respect to the external magnetic field. Theoretical results quantitatively explain frequency contrast between GM, WM, and CSF previously reported in motor cortex area, including the absence of the contrast between WM and CSF. Comparison of theory and experiment also suggests that in a normal human brain, proteins, lipids, and non-heme iron provide comparable contributions to tissue phase contrast; however, the sign of iron and lipid contributions is opposite to the sign of contribution from proteins. These effects of cellular composition and architecture are important for quantification of tissue microstructure based on MRI phase measurements. Also theory predicts the dependence of the signal phase on the orientation of WM fibers, holding promise as additional information for fiber tracking applications.},

Here, we investigated the between-subject and regional associations between CBF and CMRO               2               measures with independent and quantitative PET techniques. We included resting CBF and CMRO               2               measurements from 50 healthy volunteers (aged 22--81\,yr), and calculated the regional and global values of oxygen delivery (Do               2               ) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). Linear mixed-model analysis showed that CBF and CMRO               2               measurements were closely associated regionally, but no significant between-subject association could be demonstrated, even when adjusting for arterial Pco               2               and hemoglobin concentration. The analysis also showed regional differences of OEF, reflecting variable relationship between Do               2               and CMRO               2               , resulting in lower estimates of OEF in thalami, brainstem, and mesial temporal cortices and higher estimates of OEF in occipital cortex. In the present study, we demonstrated no between-subject association of quantitative measurements of CBF and CMRO               2               in healthy subjects. Thus, quantitative measurements of CBF did not reflect the underlying between-subject variability of oxygen metabolism measures, mainly because of large interindividual OEF variability not accounted for by Pco               2               and hemoglobin concentration.

  abstract = {R2* relaxometry of the brain is a quantitative magnetic resonance technique which is influenced by iron and myelin content across different brain regions. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common inflammatory, demyelinating disease affecting both white and grey matter regions of the CNS. Using R2*, increased iron deposition has been described in deep gray matter of MS patients. Iron accumulation might promote oxidative stress in the brain, which can lead to cell death and neurodegeneration. However, recent histological work indicates that iron may be reduced within the normal appearing white matter (WM) in MS. In the present study we analyzed the R2* signal across the white matter in 39 patients with MS, 31 asymptomatic age matched siblings of patients and 30 age-matched controls. The measurement of R2* in white matter is affected by the signal's dependency on white matter fibre orientation with respect to the main magnetic field which can be accounted using diffusion tensor imaging. We observed a clear separation of the three study groups in R2*. The values in the MS group were significantly lower compared to the siblings and controls, while the siblings group presented with significantly higher R2* values than both unrelated healthy controls and patients. Furthermore, we found significantly decreased normal-appearing white matter R2* values in patients with more severe disease course. Angle resolved analysis of R2* improves the sensitivity for detecting subtle differences in WM R2* compared to standard histogram based analyses. Our findings suggest that the decreased R2* values in MS are due to diffuse tissue damage and decreased myelin in the normal appearing and diffusely abnormal WM. The increased R2* in unaffected siblings may identify a predisposition to increased iron and the potential for oxidative stress as a risk factor for developing MS.},

  abstract = {Brain activity observed at many spatiotemporal scales exhibits a 1/f-like power spectrum, including neuronal membrane potentials, neural field potentials, noninvasive electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging signals. A 1/f-like power spectrum is indicative of arrhythmic brain activity that does not contain a predominant temporal scale (hence, ``scale-free''). This characteristic of scale-free brain activity distinguishes it from brain oscillations. While scale-free brain activity and brain oscillations coexist, our understanding of the former remains very limited. Recent research has shed light on the spatiotemporal organization, functional significance and potential generative mechanisms of scale-free brain activity, as well as its developmental and clinical relevance. A deeper understanding of this prevalent brain signal should provide new insights and analytical tools for cognitive neuroscience.},

  abstract = {It has been shown recently that a significant portion of brain electrical field potentials consists of scale-free dynamics. These scale-free brain dynamics contain complex spatiotemporal structures and are modulated by task performance. Here we show that the fMRI signal recorded from the human brain is also scale free; its power-law exponent differentiates between brain networks and correlates with fMRI signal variance and brain glucose metabolism. Importantly, in parallel to brain electrical field potentials, the variance and power-law exponent of the fMRI signal decrease during task activation, suggesting that the signal contains more long-range memory during rest and conversely is more efficient at online information processing during task. Remarkably, similar changes also occurred in task-deactivated brain regions, revealing the presence of an optimal dynamic range in the fMRI signal. The scale-free properties of the fMRI signal and brain electrical field potentials bespeak their respective stationarity and nonstationarity. This suggests that neurovascular coupling mechanism is likely to contain a transformation from nonstationarity to stationarity. In summary, our results demonstrate the functional relevance of scale-free properties of the fMRI signal and impose constraints on future models of neurovascular coupling.},

Theoretical and experimental studies show that critical systems often exhibit optimal computational properties, suggesting the possibility that criticality has been evolutionarily selected as a useful trait for our nervous system. Evidence for criticality has been found in cell cultures, brain slices, and anesthetized animals. Yet, inconsistent results were reported for recordings in awake animals and humans, and current results point to open questions about the exact nature and mechanism of criticality, as well as its functional role. Therefore, the criticality hypothesis has remained a controversial proposition. Here, we provide an account of the mathematical and physical foundations of criticality. In the light of this conceptual framework, we then review and discuss recent experimental studies with the aim of identifying important next steps to be taken and connections to other fields that should be explored.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS:               We conducted a multicenter, retrospective analysis of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network. Perinatal and neonatal variables and outcomes were compared between epochs. Neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 22 months' corrected age were evaluated with neurologic exams and Bayley Scales of Infant Development II. Logistic regression analyses determined the independent risk of epoch for adverse outcomes.                                         RESULTS:               Infant survival was similar between epochs (epoch 1, 35.4\%, vs epoch 2, 32.3\%; P = .09). A total of 411 of 452 surviving infants in epoch 1 and 405 of 438 surviving infants in epoch 2 were evaluated at 18 to 22 months' corrected age. Cesarean delivery (P = .03), surgery for patent ductus arteriosus (P = .004), and late sepsis (P = .01) were more common in epoch 2, but postnatal steroid use was dramatically reduced (63.5\% vs 32.8\%; P \&lt; .0001). Adverse outcomes at 18 to 22 months' corrected age were common in both epochs. Moderate-to-severe cerebral palsy was diagnosed in 11.1\% of surviving infants in epoch 1 and 14.9\% in epoch 2 (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.52 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.86--2.71]; P = .15), the Mental Developmental Index was \&lt;70 in 44.9\% in epoch 1 and 51\% in epoch 2 (OR: 1.30 [95\% CI: 0.91--1.87]; P = .15), and neurodevelopmental impairment was diagnosed in 50.1\% of surviving infants in epoch 1 and 58.7\% in epoch 2 (OR: 1.4 [95\% CI: 0.98--2.04]; P = .07).

All analysis methods consistently showed that fractional anisotropy (FA; a measure of microstructural integrity) was higher in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) in WS compared with both control groups. There was a significant association with deficits in visuospatial construction and higher FA in WS individuals. Comparable increases in FA across analytic methods were not observed in the left SLF or the bilateral inferior longitudinal fasciculus in WS subjects. Together, these findings suggest a specific role of right SLF abnormality in visuospatial construction deficits in WS.},

However, how E/I imbalance arises and how it may differ across autism symptomatology and brain regions is not well understood. We used innovative analysis methods---combining competitive gene-set analysis and gene-expression profiles in relation to cortical thickness (CT) to investigate relationships between genetic variance, brain structure and autism symptomatology of participants from the AIMS-2-TRIALS LEAP cohort (autism\,=\,359, male/female\,=\,258/101; neurotypical control participants\,=\,279, male/female\,=\,178/101) aged 6--30\,years. Using competitive gene-set analyses, we investigated whether aggregated genetic variation in glutamate and GABA gene-sets could be associated with behavioral measures of autism symptoms and brain structural variation. Further, using the same gene-sets, we corelated expression profiles throughout the cortex with differences in CT between autistic and neurotypical control participants, as well as in separate sensory subgroups. The glutamate gene-set was associated with all autism symptom severity scores on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) within the autistic group. In adolescents and adults, brain regions with greater gene-expression of glutamate and GABA genes showed greater differences in CT between autistic and neurotypical control participants although in opposing directions. Additionally, the gene expression profiles were associated with CT profiles in separate sensory subgroups. Our results suggest complex relationships between E/I related genetics and autism symptom profiles as well as brain structure alterations, where there may be differential roles for glutamate and GABA.},

Background: The biochemical defect underlying RS is unknown. Because in vivo MRSI can detect important cerebral metabolites, MRSI has a potential to reveal impairment of regional cerebral metabolism in RS noninvasively. Methods: Highresolution, multislice 1 H MRSI was carried out in 17 girls with RS. The control group consisted of nine healthy children. Results: In patients with RS, average Cho concentration was 12\% higher (p , 0.005) and average NAA concentration 11\% lower (p , 0.0001) compared with the control group. Regional metabolic differences included significantly lower NAA concentration in the frontal gray and white matter, insula, and hippocampus in RS; no difference in regional Cho and Cr concentrations were found. A 20 to 38\% higher Cho:NAA ratio in frontal and parietal gray and white matter, insular gray matter, and hippocampus (p , 0.05) and a 14 to 47\% lower NAA:Cr ratio in frontal cortical gray matter, parietal and temporal white matter, insula, and putamen (p , 0.05) were found in subjects with RS compared with controls. Patients with seizures had higher average concentrations of Cho, Cr, and NAA compared with those without seizures (8 -19\%, p , 0.05). Conclusion: Metabolic impairment in RS involves both gray and white matter and particularly involves frontal and parietal lobes and the insular cortex. Loss of NAA most likely reflects reduced neuronal and dendritic tree size; increased Cho concentration may result from gliosis.

  abstract = {The most dynamic postnatal brain development takes place during human infancy. Decades of histological studies have identified strong spatial and functional maturation gradients in human brain gray and white matter. The improvements in noninvasive imaging techniques, especially magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, positron emission tomography, and near-infrared spectroscopy, have provided unprecedented opportunities to quantify and map the early developmental changes at whole brain and regional levels. Unique to infant brain imaging, tailored infant image acquisition and analysis methods---such as motion correction, high-resolution imaging, optimization of imaging parameters for smaller and immature brain, age-specific brain atlas and parcellation scheme, age-specific white matter tractography, functional connectivity analysis given incomplete brain networks, and advanced gray and white matter segmentation for infant brains should be taken into consideration. Delineating functional, physiological, and structural changes of the infant brain through imaging provides insights into the complicated processes of both typical development and the neuropathological mechanisms underlying various brain disorders with early onset in infancy, such as autistic spectrum disorder. Identification of imaging biomarkers of neurodevelopmental disorders during infancy by leveraging techniques such as machine learning may offer a valuable time window for early intervention.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Diffusion tensor imaging has been used before in testing associations between cigarette smoking and white matter integrity, with inconsistent results. Published reports indicate higher fractional anisotropy (FA, a measure of linear water diffusion) in some brain regions and lower FA in others in adult smokers compared to nonsmokers. Adolescent smokers exhibited elevated FA at several brain regions and a positive correlation of FA in the genu corpus callosum with exposure to smoking (pack-years). OBJECTIVE: To help resolve prior discrepancies, we studied adults, sampling multiple brain regions, and testing for relationships to clinical features of nicotine dependence and exposure to smoking. METHODS: Brain MRI scans (1.5~T) were acquired, and FA and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC, a measure of random diffusion) were assayed in corpus callosum and prefrontal white matter, corona radiata, internal capsule, cingulum bundle, and hippocampal perforant fibers in 18 smokers (33.7\,\textpm\,7.9~years of age) and 18 age- and gender-matched nonsmokers. RESULTS: ADC showed no group difference, but smokers had higher (4.3-21.1\%) FA than nonsmokers. The differences were significant in right prefrontal white matter, cingulum, and genu corpus callosum. FA in several regions was negatively correlated with nicotine dependence or cigarettes/day. CONCLUSIONS: Combined with earlier findings, these results suggest a model of changing trajectories whereby FA is higher with tobacco exposure during adolescence and declines with continued smoking in adulthood. This notion is supported by the observation that, at multiple sampling sites, participants who had started smoking earlier in life had higher FA than those who had started later.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Definition in the living premature infant of the anatomical and temporal characteristics of development of critical brain structures is crucial for insight into the time of greatest vulnerability of such brain structures. We used three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D MRI) and image-processing algorithms to quantitate total brain volume and total volumes of cerebral gray matter (GM), unmyelinated white matter (WM), myelinated WM, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 78 premature and mature newborns (postconceptional age, 29--41 weeks). Total brain tissue volume was shown to increase linearly at a rate of 22 ml/wk. Total GM showed a linear increase in relative intracranial volume of approxi mately 1.4\% or 15 ml in absolute volume per week. The pronounced increase in total GM reflected primarily a fourfold increase in cortical GM. Unmyelinated WM was found to be the most prominent brain tissue class in the preterm infant younger than 36 weeks of postconceptional age. Although minimal myelinated WM was present in the preterm infant at 29 weeks, between 35 and 41 weeks an abrupt fivefold increase in absolute volume of myelinated WM was documented. Extracerebral and intraventricular CSF was readily quantitated by this technique and found to change minimally. The application of 3D MRI and tissue segmentation to the study of human infant brain from 29 to 41 weeks of postconceptional age has provided new insights into cerebral cortical development and myelination and has for the first time provided means of quantitative assessment in vivo of early human brain development.},

This study examines cognitive, academic, and behavioral outcomes at age 8 years for a regional cohort of EP/ELBW children born in 1997. METHODS: The EP/ELBW cohort comprised all live births with a gestational age {$<$}28 weeks (EP) or birth weight {$<$}1000 g (ELBW) born in the state of Victoria, Australia, in 1997. Of 317 live births, 201 (63.4\%) survived to 2 years of age.A term/normal birth weight (T/NBW) cohort was recruited comprising 199 infants with birthweights {$\geq$}2500 g or gestational age {$\geq$}37 weeks [corrected]. Measures of intellectual ability, educational achievement, and behavior were administered at age 8. RESULTS: Retention was 94\% for the EP/ELBW group and 87\% for the T/NBW group. The EP/ELBW group performed poorer than the T/NBW group on measures of IQ, educational achievement, and certain behavioral domains, even after adjustment for sociodemographic factors and exclusion of children with neurosensory impairment. The rate of any neurobehavioral impairment was elevated in the EP/ELBW group (71\% vs 42\%), and one-half of subjects had multiple impairments. The outcomes for those with {$<$}750 g birth weight or {$<$}26 weeks' gestational age were similar to those with a birth weight of 750 to 999 g or a gestational age of 26 to 27 weeks, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite ongoing improvements in the management of EP/ELBW infants, the rate of neurobehavioral impairment at school-age remains too high relative to controls.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: One leading hypothesis suggests that schizophrenia (SZ) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by genetic defects in association with environmental risk factors that affect synapse and myelin formation. Recent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of SZ brain showed both gray matter (GM) reduction and white matter (WM) fractional anisotropy reduction. In this study, we used T1-weighted (T1w)/T2-weighted (T2w) MRI ratio images, which increase myelin-related signal contrast and reduce receiver-coil bias. METHODS: We measured T1w/T2w ratio image signal intensity in 29 patients with SZ and 33 healthy controls (HCs), and then compared them against bias-corrected T1w images. RESULTS: Mean T1w/T2w ratio signal intensity values across all SZ GM and WM voxels were significantly lower than those for the HC values (analysis of covariance with age, gender, handedness, and premorbid intelligence quotient as nuisance covariates). SZ mean WM T1w/T2w ratio values were related to Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores and were inversely related to the positive psychotic symptoms of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Voxel-based analysis revealed significantly lower T1w/T2w ratio image signal intensity values in the right ventral putamen in SZ GM. T1w image intensities did not differ between the SZ and HC groups. CONCLUSIONS: T1-weighted/T2-weighted ratio imaging increased the detectability of SZ pathological changes. Reduced SZ brain signal intensity is likely due to diminished myelin content; therefore, mapping myelin-related SZ brain changes using T1w/T2w ratio images may be useful for studies of SZ brain abnormalities.},

  abstract = {Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a common heterogeneous neurological disorder with a wide range of possible clinical outcomes. Accurate prediction of outcome is desirable for optimal treatment. This study aimed both to identify the demographic, clinical, and computed tomographic (CT) characteristics associated with unfavorable outcome at 6 months after mTBI, and to design a prediction model for application in daily practice. All consecutive mTBI patients (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score: 13-15) admitted to our hospital who were age 16 or older were included during an 8-year period as part of the prospective Radboud University Brain Injury Cohort Study (RUBICS). Outcome was assessed at 6 months post-trauma using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE), dichotomized into unfavorable (GOSE score 1-6) and favorable (GOSE score 7-8) outcome groups. The predictive value of several variables was determined using multivariate binary logistic regression analysis. We included 2784 mTBI patients and found CT abnormalities in 20.7\% of the 1999 patients that underwent a head CT. Age, extracranial injuries, and day-of-injury alcohol intoxication proved to be the strongest outcome predictors. The presence of facial fractures and the number of hemorrhagic contusions emerged as CT predictors. Furthermore, we showed that the predictive value of a scheme based on a modified Injury Severity Score (ISS), alcohol intoxication, and age equalled the value of one that also included CT characteristics. In fact, it exceeded one that was based on CT characteristics alone. We conclude that, although valuable for the identification of the individual mTBI patient at risk for deterioration and eventual neurosurgical intervention, CT characteristics are imperfect predictors of outcome after mTBI.},

  abstract = {Neonatal congenital heart disease (CHD) is associated with altered cerebral hemodynamics and increased risk of brain injury. Two novel noninvasive techniques, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffuse optical and correlation spectroscopies (diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS), diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS)), were employed to quantify cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen metabolism (CMRO(2)) of 32 anesthetized CHD neonates at rest and during hypercapnia. Cerebral venous oxygen saturation (S(v)O(2)) and CBF were measured simultaneously with MRI in the superior sagittal sinus, yielding global oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and global CMRO(2) in physiologic units. In addition, microvascular tissue oxygenation (StO(2)) and indices of microvascular CBF (BFI) and CMRO(2) (CMRO(2)(i)) in the frontal cortex were determined by DOS/DCS. Median resting-state MRI-measured OEF, CBF, and CMRO(2) were 0.38, 9.7\,mL/minute per 100\,g and 0.52\,mL O(2)/minute per 100\,g, respectively. These CBF and CMRO(2) values are lower than literature reports for healthy term neonates (which are sparse and quantified using different methods) and resemble values reported for premature infants. Comparison of MRI measurements of global S(v)O(2), CBF, and CMRO(2) with corresponding local DOS/DCS measurements demonstrated strong linear correlations (R(2)=0.69, 0.67, 0.67; P{$<$}0.001), permitting calibration of DOS/DCS indices. The results suggest that MRI and optics offer new tools to evaluate cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism in CHD neonates.},

Measurement of blood oxygen saturation (HbO(2)) and flow in the major cerebral outflow and inflow vessels can provide a global estimate of CMRO(2). We demonstrate a rapid noninvasive method for quantifying CMRO(2) by simultaneously measuring venous oxygen saturation in the superior sagittal sinus with magnetic resonance susceptometry-based oximetry, a technique that exploits the intrinsic susceptibility of deoxygenated hemoglobin, and the average blood inflow rate with phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging. The average venous HbO(2), cerebral blood flow, and global CMRO(2) values in eight healthy, normal study subjects were 64\%+/-4\%, 45.2+/-3.2 mL per 100 g per minute, and 127+/-7 micromol per 100 g per minute, respectively. These values are in good agreement with those reported in literature. The technique described is noninvasive, robust, and reproducible for in vivo applications, making it ideal for use in clinical settings for assessing the pathologies associated with dysregulation of cerebral metabolism. In addition, the short acquisition time (approximately 30 seconds) makes the technique suitable for studying the temporal variations in CMRO(2) in response to physiologic challenges.},

In this study, we sought to further investigate the vascular and metabolic effects of hypercapnia by simultaneously measuring global venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) and total cerebral blood flow (tCBF), with a temporal resolution of 30 seconds using magnetic resonance susceptometry and phase-contrast techniques in 10 healthy awake adults. While significant increases in SvO2 and tCBF were observed during hypercapnia (P {$<$} 0.005), no change in CMRO2 was noted (P {$>$} 0.05). Additionally, fractional changes in tCBF and end-tidal carbon dioxide (R2 = 0.72, P {$<$} 0.005), as well as baseline SvO2 and tCBF (R2 = 0.72, P {$<$} 0.005), were found to be correlated. The data also suggested a correlation between cerebral vascular reactivity (CVR) and baseline tCBF (R2 = 0.44, P = 0.052). A CVR value of 6.1\% \textpm{} 1.6\%/mm Hg was determined using a linear-fit model.

Recently, it was shown that single-electrode EEG in preterms at birth exhibits scale-invariant intermittent bursts. Yet, it is currently not known whether the normal infant brain, in particular, the cortex, maintains a distinct dynamical state during development that is characterized by scale-invariant spatial as well as temporal aspects. Here we employ dense-array EEG recordings acquired from the same infants at 6 and 12 months of age to characterize brain activity during an auditory odd-ball task. We show that suprathreshold events organize as spatiotemporal clusters whose size and duration are power-law distributed, the hallmark of neuronal avalanches. Time series of local suprathreshold EEG events display significant long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs). No differences were found between 6 and 12 months, demonstrating stability of avalanche dynamics and LRTCs during the first year after birth. These findings demonstrate that the infant brain is characterized by distinct spatiotemporal dynamical aspects that are in line with expectations of a critical cortical state. We suggest that critical state dynamics, which theory and experiments have shown to be beneficial for numerous aspects of information processing, are maintained by the infant brain to process an increasingly complex environment during development.},

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is among the most common neurological disorders. Hemorrhagic lesions and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) are radiological features associated with moderate and severe TBI. Brain volume reductions have also been observed during the months following injury. In concussion, no signs of injury are observed on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which may be a true feature of concussion or merely due to the limited sensitivity of imaging techniques used so far. Moreover, it is not known whether volume reductions are due to the resolution of trauma-related edema or a true volume loss. Forty-five collegiate-level ice hockey players (20 females) and 15 controls (9 females), 40 players underwent 3-T MRI for hemorrhages [multi-echo susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI)], WMH (three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery), and brain volume at the beginning and the end of the hockey season. Concussed athletes underwent additional imaging and neuropsychological testing at 3\,days, 2\,weeks, and 2\,months after injury. At the end of the hockey season, brain volume was reduced compared to controls by 0.32\% (p\,{$<$}\,0.034) in the whole cohort and by 0.26\% (p\,{$<$}\,0.09) in the concussed athletes. Two weeks and 2\,months after concussion, brain volume was reduced by -0.08\% (p\,=\,0.027) and -0.23\% (p\,=\,0.035), respectively. In athletes, the WMH were significantly closer to the interface between gray matter and white matter compared to controls. No significant changes in the number of WMH over the duration of the study were found in athletes. No microhemorrhages were detected as a result of concussion or playing a season of ice hockey. We conclude that mild TBI does not lead to transient increases in brain volume and no new microbleeds or WMH are detectable after concussion. Brain volume reductions appear by 2\,weeks after concussion and persist until at least 2\,months after concussion. Brain volume is reduced between the beginning and the end of the ice hockey season.},

Many different automatic registration methods have been proposed to date, and almost all share a common mathematical framework - one of optimising a cost function. To date little attention has been focused on the optimisation method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimisation. This paper examines the assumptions underlying the problem of registration for brain images using inter-modal voxel similarity measures. It is demonstrated that the use of local optimisation methods together with the standard multi-resolution approach is not sufficient to reliably find the global minimum. To address this problem, a global optimisation method is proposed that is specifically tailored to this form of registration. A full discussion of all the necessary implementation details is included as this is an important part of any practical method. Furthermore, results are presented for inter-modal, inter-subject registration experiments that show that the proposed method is more reliable at finding the global minimum than several of the currently available registration packages in common usage.},

Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function to determine the best registration. To date, little attention has been focused on the optimization method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution local optimization methods can, and do, get trapped in local minima. To address this problem, two approaches are taken: (1) to apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel hybrid global-local optimization method. This new optimization method is specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It substantially reduces the likelihood of producing misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima. The increased robustness of the method, compared to other commonly used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition, the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of experiments with motion correction. These motion correction experiments also investigate how the results are affected by different cost functions and interpolation methods.},

Methods: We developed a pulse sequence, named accelerated T2-relaxation-under-phase-contrast (aTRUPC), which consists of velocity-encoding phase-contrast module to isolate pure blood signal, flow-insensitive T2-preparation to quantify blood T2, and turbo-field-echo (TFE) scheme for rapid image acquisition, which is critical for neonatal MRI. A series of studies were conducted. First, the pulse sequence was optimized in terms of TFE factor, velocity encoding (VENC), and slice thickness for best sensitivity. Second, to account for the influence of TFE acquisition on T2 quantification, simulation and experiments were conducted to establish the relationship between TFE-T2 and standard T2. Finally, the complete aTRUPC sequence was applied on a group of healthy neonates and normative Yv values were determined. Results: Optimal parameters of aTRUPC in neonates were found to be a TFE factor of 15, VENC of 5cm/s, and slice thickness of 10mm. TFE-T2 was on average 3.9\% lower than standard T2. These two measures were strongly correlated (R2=0.86), thus their difference can be accounted for by a correction equation, T2,standard=1.2002\texttimes T2,TFE-10.6276. Neonatal Yv values in veins draining cortical brain and those draining central brain were 64.8\textpm 2.9\% and 70.2\textpm 3.3\%, respectively, with a significant difference (P=0.02). Conclusion: aTRUPC MRI has the potential to provide vessel-specific quantification of cerebral Yv in neonates.},

An important gap yet to be addressed is optimization of fetal fMRI preprocessing. Rapid developmental changes, imaged within the maternal compartment using an abdominal coil, introduce novel constraints that challenge established methods used in adult fMRI. This study evaluates the impact of (1) normalization to a group mean-age template versus normalization to an age-matched template; (2) independent components analysis (ICA) denoising at two criterion thresholds; and (3) smoothing using three kernel sizes. Data were collected from 121 fetuses (25--39 weeks, 43.8\% female). Results indicate that the mean age template is superior in older fetuses, but less optimal in younger fetuses. ICA denoising at a more stringent threshold is superior to less stringent denoising. A larger smoothing kernel can enhance cross-hemisphere functional connectivity. Overall, this study provides improved understanding of the impact of specific steps on fetal image quality. Findings can be used to inform a common set of best practices for fetal fMRI preprocessing.},

However, the pathological processes linking traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative disease remain poorly understood. Growing evidence supports a role for neuroinflammation in the development of Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, little is known about the neuroinflammatory response to brain injury and, in particular, its temporal dynamics and any potential role in neurodegeneration. Cases of traumatic brain injury with survivals ranging from 10 h to 47 years post injury (n = 52) and age-matched, uninjured control subjects (n = 44) were selected from the Glasgow Traumatic Brain Injury archive. From these, sections of the corpus callosum and adjacent parasaggital cortex were examined for microglial density and morphology, and for indices of white matter pathology and integrity. With survival of {$\geq$}3 months from injury, cases with traumatic brain injury frequently displayed extensive, densely packed, reactive microglia (CR3/43- and/or CD68-immunoreactive), a pathology not seen in control subjects or acutely injured cases. Of particular note, these reactive microglia were present in 28\% of cases with survival of {$>$}1 year and up to 18 years post-trauma. In cases displaying this inflammatory pathology, evidence of ongoing white matter degradation could also be observed. Moreover, there was a 25\% reduction in the corpus callosum thickness with survival {$>$}1 year post-injury. These data present striking evidence of persistent inflammation and ongoing white matter degeneration for many years after just a single traumatic brain injury in humans. Future studies to determine whether inflammation occurs in response to or, conversely, promotes white matter degeneration will be important. These findings may provide parallels for studying neurodegenerative disease, with traumatic brain injury patients serving as a model for longitudinal investigations, in particular with a view to identifying potential therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of disorders of movement and posture resulting from nonprogressive disturbances of the fetal or neonatal brain. More than 80\% of cases of CP in term infants originate in the prenatal period; in premature infants, both prenatal or postnatal causes contribute. The most prevalent pathological lesion seen in CP is periventricular white matter injury (PWMI) resulting from vulnerability of the immature oligodendrocytes (pre-OLs) before 32 wk of gestation. PWMI is responsible for the spastic diplegia form of CP and a spectrum of cognitive and behavioral disorders. Oxidative stress and excitotoxicity resulting from excessive stimulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors on preOLs are the most prominent molecular mechanisms for PWMI. Asphyxia around the time of birth in term infants accounts for less than 15\% of CP in developed countries but the incidence is higher in underdeveloped areas. Asphyxia causes a different pattern of brain injury and CP than is seen after preterm injuries. This type of CP is associated with the clinical syndrome of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy shortly after the insult, and the cortex, basal ganglia, and brainstem are selectively vulnerable to injury. Experimental models indicate that neurons in the neonatal brain are more likely to die by delayed apoptosis extending over days to weeks than those in the adult brain. Neurons die by glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity involving downstream caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death pathways. Recent reports indicate that males and females preferentially utilize different pathways. Clinical trials indicate that mild hypothermia reduces death or disability in term infants following asphyxia and basic research suggests that this approach might be combined with pharmacological strategies in the future.},

In a study of amino acid neurotransmitter receptors using receptor autoradiography in tissue slices of frontal cortex and the basal ganglia, we found a biphasic age-related pattern with relatively high receptor densities in young RS girls and lower densities at later time. Using microarray analysis of gene expression in frontal cortex, we found that some of the most prominent alterations occurred in gene products related to synapses, including the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit, the cytoskeletal protein MAP-2 and synaptic vesicle proteins. Using a new antibody that recognizes MeCP2, the transcription factor mutated in RS, we established that most neurons in the rodent brain express this transcription factor. We hypothesize that a major effect of mutations in the MeCP2 protein is to cause age-related disruption of synaptic proliferation and pruning in the first decade of life.},

  abstract = {Obtaining reliable data and drawing meaningful and robust inferences from diffusion MRI can be challenging and is subject to many pitfalls. The process of quantifying diffusion indices and eventually comparing them between groups of subjects and/or correlating them with other parameters starts at the acquisition of the raw data, followed by a long pipeline of image processing steps. Each one of these steps is susceptible to sources of bias, which may not only limit the accuracy and precision, but can lead to substantial errors. This article provides a detailed review of the steps along the analysis pipeline and their associated pitfalls. These are grouped into 1 pre-processing of data; 2 estimation of the tensor; 3 derivation of voxelwise quantitative parameters; 4 strategies for extracting quantitative parameters; and finally 5 intra-subject and inter-subject comparison, including region of interest, histogram, tract-specific and voxel-based analyses. The article covers important aspects of diffusion MRI analysis, such as motion correction, susceptibility and eddy current distortion correction, model fitting, region of interest placement, histogram and voxel-based analysis. We have assembled 25 pitfalls (several previously unreported) into a single article, which should serve as a useful reference for those embarking on new diffusion MRI-based studies, and as a check for those who may already be running studies but may have overlooked some important confounds. While some of these problems are well known to diffusion experts, they might not be to other researchers wishing to undertake a clinical study based on diffusion MRI.},

Reference ranges for the hematocrit and the blood hemoglobin concentration of newborn infants have previously been reported from relatively small sample sizes by using measurement methods that now are considered outmoded. METHODS: We sought to develop reference ranges for hematocrit and hemoglobin during the neonatal period (28 days) by using very large sample sizes and modern hematology analyzers, accounting for gestational and postnatal age and gender. Data were assembled from a multihospital health care system after exclusion of patients with a high likelihood of an abnormal value and those who were receiving blood transfusions. RESULTS: During the interval from 22 to 40 weeks' gestation, the hematocrit and blood hemoglobin concentration increased approximately linearly. For every week advance in gestational age, the hematocrit increased by 0.64\% and the hemoglobin concentration increased by 0.21 g/dL. No difference was seen on the basis of gender. During the 4-hour interval after birth, hematocrit/hemoglobin values of late preterm and term neonates (35-42 weeks' gestation) increased by 3.6\% +/- 0.5\% (mean +/- SD), those of neonates of 29 to 34 weeks' gestation remained unchanged, and those of {$<$}29 weeks' gestation decreased by 6.0\% +/- 0.3\%. During the first 28 days after birth, an approximately linear decrease in hematocrit/hemoglobin occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The figures presented herein describe reference ranges for hematocrit and blood hemoglobin concentration during the neonatal period, accounting for gestational and postnatal age.},

Thereby, QSM can reveal pathological changes of these key components in a variety of diseases. QSM requires multiple processing steps such as phase unwrapping, background field removal and field-to-source-inversion. Current state of the art techniques utilize iterative optimization procedures to solve the inversion and background field correction, which are computationally expensive and require a careful choice of regularization parameters. With the recent success of deep learning using convolutional neural networks for solving ill-posed reconstruction problems, the QSM community also adapted these techniques and demonstrated that the QSM processing steps can be solved by efficient feed forward multiplications not requiring iterative optimization nor the choice of regularization parameters. Here, we review the current status of deep learning based approaches for processing QSM, highlighting limitations and potential pitfalls, and discuss the future directions the field may take to exploit the latest advances in deep learning for QSM.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Difficulty providing accurate diagnosis and prognosis, especially after mild forms of traumatic brain injury (TBI), has increased efforts to detect changes in white matter microstructure using advanced neuroimaging techniques. Although methods such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have greatly increased knowledge of white matter changes resulting from TBI, several shortcomings limit the utility of these techniques particularly when applied to populations with mild TBI (mTBI) history. In vivo imaging of myelin may be particularly well suited to detect changes in white matter microstructure resulting from mTBI. REVIEW: This manuscript will briefly review the animal and histological data supporting the important role of myelin following TBI, contributions and shortcomings of the use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in mild TBI and the utility of multi-component relaxometry (MCR) techniques as a method for improved visualizing of white matter microstructural integrity in myelin. CONCLUSION: The use of MCR-based techniques has potential as a clinical and research tool to assess and track changes in myelin as well as the common behavioural changes such as slowed processing speed following TBI.},

  abstract = {Focal cortical dysplasia is a malformation of cortical development, which is the most common cause of medically refractory epilepsy in the pediatric population and the second/third most common etiology of medically intractable seizures in adults.Both genetic and acquired factors are involved in the pathogenesis of cortical dysplasia. Numerous classifications of the complex structural abnormalities of focal cortical dysplasia have been proposed - from Taylor et al. in 1971 to the last modification of Palmini classification made by Blumcke in 2011. In general, three types of cortical dysplasia are recognized.Type I focal cortical dysplasia with mild symptomatic expression and late onset, is more often seen in adults, with changes present in the temporal lobe.Clinical symptoms are more severe in type II of cortical dysplasia usually seen in children. In this type, more extensive changes occur outside the temporal lobe with predilection for the frontal lobes.New type III is one of the above dysplasias with associated another principal lesion as hippocampal sclerosis, tumor, vascular malformation or acquired pathology during early life.Brain MRI imaging shows abnormalities in the majority of type II dysplasias and in only some of type I cortical dysplasias.THE MOST COMMON FINDINGS ON MRI IMAGING INCLUDE: focal cortical thickening or thinning, areas of focal brain atrophy, blurring of the gray-white junction, increased signal on T2- and FLAIR-weighted images in the gray and subcortical white matter often tapering toward the ventricle. On the basis of the MRI findings, it is possible to differentiate between type I and type II cortical dysplasia. A complete resection of the epileptogenic zone is required for seizure-free life. MRI imaging is very helpful to identify those patients who are likely to benefit from surgical treatment in a group of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.However, in type I cortical dysplasia, MR imaging is often normal, and also in both types the lesion seen on MRI may be smaller than the seizure-generating region seen in the EEG. The abnormalities may also involve vital for life brain parts, where curative surgery will not be an option. Therefore, other diagnostic imaging techniques such as FDG PET, MEG, DTI and intra-cranial EEG are widely used to establish the diagnosis and to decide on management.With advances in both genetics and neuroimaging, we may develop a better understanding of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, which will help us to provide more successful pharmacological and/or surgical treatment in the future.},

  abstract = {Supportive care with mechanical ventilation continues to be an essential strategy for managing severe neonatal respiratory failure; however, it is well known to cause and accentuate neonatal lung injury. The pathogenesis of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is multifactorial and complex, resulting predominantly from interactions between ventilator-related factors and patient-related factors. Importantly, VILI is a significant risk factor for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the most common chronic respiratory morbidity of preterm infants that lacks specific therapies, causes life-long morbidities, and imposes psychosocial and economic burdens. Studies of older children and adults suggest that understanding how and why VILI occurs is essential to developing strategies for mitigating VILI and its consequences. This article reviews the preclinical and clinical evidence on the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of VILI in neonates. We also highlight the evidence behind various lung-protective strategies to guide clinicians in preventing and attenuating VILI and, by extension, BPD in neonates. Further, we provide a snapshot of future directions that may help minimize neonatal VILI.},

  abstract = {Purpose               To develop a deep neural network to recover filtered phase from clinical MR phase images to enable the computation of QSMs.                                         Methods               Eighteen deep learning networks were trained to recover combinations of 13 SWI phase-filtering pipelines. SWI-filtered data were computed offline from five multiorientation, multiecho MRI scans yielding 132 3D volumes (118/7/7 training/validation/testing). Two experiments were conducted to show the efficacy of the networks. First, using QSM processing, local fields were computed from the raw phase and subsequently filtered using the SWI-filtering pipelines. The networks were then trained to invert the filtering operation. Second, the trained networks were fine-tuned to recover unfiltered local fields from filtered local fields computed by applying QSM processing to the SWI-filtered phase. Susceptibility maps were computed from the recovered fields and compared with gold standard multiple orientation sampling reconstructions.                                         Results               Susceptibility maps computed from the raw phase using standard QSM processing have a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.732~\textpm ~0.095. Susceptibility maps computed from the recovered phase obtained NRMSEs of 0.725~\textpm ~0.095. The network trained using all 13 processing methods generalized well, obtaining NRMSEs of 0.725~\textpm ~0.89 on filters it has not seen, while matching the reconstruction accuracy of networks trained to recover a single filter.                                         Conclusion               It is feasible to recover SWI-filtered phase using deep learning. QSM can be computed from the recovered phase from SWI acquisition with comparable accuracy to standard QSM processing.},

Most patients will return to baseline and experience full recovery, although a subset experiences persistent symptoms. Newer animal models and imaging studies are beginning to demonstrate that metabolic and neurovascular resolution may actually take longer than symptomatic recovery. Repeat traumatic brain injury within the metabolic window of dysfunction may result in worsened symptoms and prolonged recovery. The true risk for second impact syndrome appears to be small, and development of cerebral edema after a mild impact may be related to genetic risks rather than serial impacts.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Nicotine use is widely prevalent among youth, and is associated with white matter microstructural changes as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In adults, nicotine use is generally associated with lower fractional anisotropy (FA), but in adolescents/young adults ({$\leq$}30 years), microstructure appears healthier, indicated by higher FA. This cross-sectional study examined associations between nicotine use and white matter microstructure using fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) in young adults. METHODS: Fifty-three participants (18 nicotine users [10 female]/35 controls [17 female]) ages 18-25 underwent MRI scan, neuropsychological battery, toxicology screening, and drug use interview. Nicotine group associations with FA and MD were examined in various white matter tracts. In significant tracts, AD and RD were measured. Exploratory correlations were conducted between significant tracts and verbal memory and sustained attention/working memory performance. RESULTS: Nicotine users exhibited significantly lower FA than controls in the left anterior thalamic radiation, left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, left superior longitudinal fasciculus-temporal, and left uncinate fasciculus. In these tracts, AD and RD did not differ, nor did MD differ in any tract. White matter quality was positively correlated with sustained attention/working memory performance. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking may disrupt white matter microstructure. These results are consistent with adult studies, but inconsistent with adolescent/young adult studies, likely due to methodological and sample age differences. Further studies should examine longitudinal effects of nicotine use on white matter microstructure in a larger sample.},

Although its use in detecting neurological abnormalities has been well described in adults and pediatrics, it application in the newborn nursery has not been explored adequately. Early detection of brain injury secondary to intrauterine and perinatal insults using PET imaging can provide new insight in prognosis and in instituting early therapy.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the patterns of diffusivity associated with cognitive domain functions in older adults without dementia. METHODS: We studied older adults without dementia (n = 220) who underwent neuropsychometric testing and a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) examination at 3 T in a cross-sectional study. Memory, language, attention/executive function, and visual-spatial processing domains were assessed within 4 months of the MRI examination. A fluid-attenuated inversion recovery-based DTI sequence that enabled uncontaminated cortical diffusion measurements was performed. Associations between cortical mean diffusivity (MD) and cognitive function were tested using voxel-based regression analysis. Association between tract diffusivity and cognitive function was tested with regions of interest drawn on color-coded fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. RESULTS: Memory function was associated with the medial temporal lobe cortical MD on voxel-based analysis (p {$<$} 0.001, corrected for multiple comparisons), and inferior longitudinal fasciculus and posterior and anterior cingulum FA on tract-based analysis (p {$<$} 0.001). Language function was associated with the left temporal lobe cortical MD (p {$<$} 0.001, corrected for multiple comparisons), inferior longitudinal fasciculus, fornix, and posterior cingulum FA (p {$<$} 0.05). Attention and executive function was associated with the posterior and anterior cingulum FA, and visual-spatial function was associated with posterior cingulum FA (p {$<$} 0.01). CONCLUSION: Specific cognitive domain functions are associated with distinct patterns of cortical and white matter diffusivity in elderly with no dementia. Posterior cingulum tract FA was associated with all 4 cognitive domain functions, in agreement with the hypothesis that the posterior cingulate cortex is the main connectivity hub for cognitive brain networks. Microstructural changes identified on DTI may be associated with neurodegenerative pathologies underlying cognitive changes in older adults without dementia.},

Therefore, we performed a systematic search of articles published in public databases and analysed the research evidence in order to provide critical information regarding e-cig safety. Electronic nicotine delivery systems (or e-cigs) are an alternative to traditional cigarettes for the delivery of nicotine and are typically filled with glycerol or propylene glycol-based solutions known as e-liquids. Though present in lower quantities, e-cig aerosols are known to contain many of the harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke. However, due to the paucity of experimental data and contradictory evidence, it is difficult to draw conclusive outcomes regarding toxicological, immunological and clinical impacts of e-cig aerosols. Excessive vaping has been reported to induce inflammatory responses including mitogen-activated protein kinase, Janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription and nuclear factor-{$\kappa$}B signalling, similar to that induced by tobacco smoke. Based on recent evidence, prolonged exposure to some constituents of e-cig aerosols might result in respiratory complications such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and inflammation. Future studies are warranted that focus on establishing correlations between e-cig types, generations and e-liquid flavours and immunological and toxicological profiles to broaden our understanding about the effects of vaping.},

Independent component analysis' demonstrated capacity to separate sources of neural signal, structured noise, and random noise into separate components might be utilized in improved procedures to remove artifacts from fMRI data. Such procedures require a method for labeling independent components (ICs) as representing artifacts to be removed or neural signals of interest to be spared. Visual inspection is often considered an accurate method for such labeling as well as a standard to which automated labeling methods are compared. However, detailed descriptions of methods for visual inspection of ICs are lacking in the literature. Here we describe the details of, and the rationale for, an operationalized fMRI data denoising procedure that involves visual inspection of ICs (96\% inter-rater agreement). We estimate that dozens of subjects/sessions can be processed within a few hours using the described method of visual inspection. Our hope is that continued scientific discussion of and testing of visual inspection methods will lead to the development of improved, cost-effective fMRI denoising procedures.},

Methods: Between January 2003 and December 2006, we prospectively enrolled 310 live-born infants between 23 and 32 weeks of gestation. The association between candidate risk factors and delayed motor or mental development (Bayley Scales of infant development II; psychomotor or mental developmental index {$<$}85) was analysed by means of logistic regression analysis.             Results: Two hundred and fifty infants were eligible for follow-up, and 205 (82.0\%) completed the follow-up visit. Intracerebral haemorrhage, small for gestational age and late-onset sepsis were associated with an increased risk for delayed development in Group I (p{$\quad<\quad$}0.05, each). Premature rupture of membranes was a risk condition relevant to Group II. Antenatal steroids were associated with a decreased risk of neurodevelopmental delay in both groups.             Conclusion: This study identified distinct risk factors for adverse outcome in preterm infants of lower ({$<$}30 weeks) and higher (30--32 weeks) gestational age. In the lower gestational age group, neonatal risk predictors are most important. Antenatal steroids appear to decrease the risk for adverse outcome in both age groups.},

In vitro               and               in vivo               experiments indicate that these spontaneous activity patterns are generated from neuronal networks in the cerebral cortex, in subcortical structures or in the sensory periphery (retina, cochlea, whiskers). At early stages spontaneous periphery-driven and also sensory evoked activity is relayed to the developing cerebral cortex via the thalamus and the neocortical subplate, which amplifies the afferent sensory input. These early local and large-scale neuronal activity patterns influence a variety of developmental processes during corticogenesis, such as neurogenesis, apoptosis, neuronal migration, differentiation and network formation. The experimental data also indicate that disturbances in early neuronal patterns may have an impact on the development of cortical layers, columns and networks. In this article we review our current knowledge on the origin of early electrical activity patterns in neocortical sensory areas and their functional implications on shaping developing cortical networks.},

Axial diffusivity, describing water movement along the axonal fiber tract, in all regions of spinal cord white matter from EAE-affected C57BL/6 mice was significantly decreased compared to normal mice, whereas there was no statistically significant change in radial diffusivity, describing water movement across the fiber tract. Furthermore, a direct comparison between DTI and histology from a single mouse demonstrated a decrease in axial diffusivity that was supported by widespread staining of antibody against beta-amyloid precursor protein. Regionally elevated radial diffusivity corresponded with locally diminished Luxol fast blue staining in the same tissue from the EAE mouse cord. Our findings suggest that axonal damage is more widespread than myelin damage in the spinal cord white matter of mice with EAE and that in vivo DTI may provide a sensitive and specific measure of white matter injury.},

One of the main challenges with scanning newborn infants, particularly when scanning without sedation in a research setting, is movement. Infant movement can affect MR image quality and therewith reliable image assessment and advanced image analysis. Applying a systematic, stepwise approach to MR scanning during the neonatal period, including the use of the feed-and-bundle technique, is effective in reducing infant motion and ensuring high-quality images. We provide recommendations for one such systematic approach, including the step-by-step preparation and infant immobilization, and highlight safety precautions to minimize any potential risks. The recommendations are primarily focused on scanning newborn infants for research purposes but may be used successfully for clinical purposes as well, granted the infant is medically stable. Using the stepwise approach in our local research setting, our success rate of acquiring high-quality, analyzable infant brain MR images during the neonatal period is as high as 91\%.},

  abstract = {Organizational events occur in a peak time period from approximately the fifth month of gestation to several years after birth. The major developmental features include (1) establishment and differentiation of the subplate neurons; (2) attainment of proper alignment, orientation, and layering (lamination) of cortical neurons; (3) gyral development; (4) elaboration of dendritic and axonal ramifications; (5) establishment of synaptic contacts; (6) cell death and selective elimination of neuronal processes and synapses; and (7) proliferation and differentiation of glia. These events are of particular importance, because they establish the elaborate circuitry that distinguishes the human brain, and they set the stage for the final developmental event, myelination. The advent of advanced immunocytochemical methodologies, the delineation of molecular genetic defects, and the use of genetically manipulated animals have provided new insights into the identity and the basis of organizational disorders. Moreover, MRI techniques are clarifying these issues in the living infant. Subplate neuronal pathology has been suggested in multiple disorders, including encephalopathy of prematurity, epilepsy, and autism. Gyral abnormalities include maldevelopment of individual gyri and/or lobes, resulting, for example, in small superior temporal gyri in Down syndrome. Dendritic pathology occurs in Rett syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome, and fragile X syndrome. Impaired axonal development occurs in multiple pediatric disorders of the central and peripheral nervous systems, leading to a spectrum of clinical disability. The application of advanced MRI methodologies to infants in the premature and perinatal periods has provided strong evidence for acquired (nongenetic) disturbances of organizational events.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, several models with network adaptive mechanisms (link deletion-creation, dynamic synapses, dynamic gains) have been proposed as examples of self-organized criticality (SOC) to explain neuronal avalanches. However, all these systems present stochastic oscillations hovering around the critical region that are incompatible with standard SOC. Here we make a linear stability analysis of the mean field fixed points of two self-organized quasi-critical systems: a fully connected network of discrete time stochastic spiking neurons with firing rate adaptation produced by dynamic neuronal gains and an excitable cellular automata with depressing synapses. We find that the fixed point corresponds to a stable focus that loses stability at criticality. We argue that when this focus is close to become indifferent, demographic noise can elicit stochastic oscillations that frequently fall into the absorbing state. This mechanism interrupts the oscillations, producing both power law avalanches and dragon king events, which appear as bands of synchronized firings in raster plots. Our approach differs from standard SOC models in that it predicts the coexistence of these different types of neuronal activity.},

  abstract = {Self-organized criticality is an attractive model for human brain dynamics, but there has been little direct evidence for its existence in large-scale systems measured by neuroimaging. In general, critical systems are associated with fractal or power law scaling, long-range correlations in space and time, and rapid reconfiguration in response to external inputs. Here, we consider two measures of phase synchronization: the phase-lock interval, or duration of coupling between a pair of (neurophysiological) processes, and the lability of global synchronization of a (brain functional) network. Using computational simulations of two mechanistically distinct systems displaying complex dynamics, the Ising model and the Kuramoto model, we show that both synchronization metrics have power law probability distributions specifically when these systems are in a critical state. We then demonstrate power law scaling of both pairwise and global synchronization metrics in functional MRI and magnetoencephalographic data recorded from normal volunteers under resting conditions. These results strongly suggest that human brain functional systems exist in an endogenous state of dynamical criticality, characterized by a greater than random probability of both prolonged periods of phase-locking and occurrence of large rapid changes in the state of global synchronization, analogous to the neuronal ``avalanches'' previously described in cellular systems. Moreover, evidence for critical dynamics was identified consistently in neurophysiological systems operating at frequency intervals ranging from 0.05--0.11 to 62.5--125 Hz, confirming that criticality is a property of human brain functional network organization at all frequency intervals in the brain's physiological bandwidth.},

METHODS: We compared outcomes of extremely low birth weight ({$<$}1 kg) and extremely low gestational age ({$<$}28 weeks) infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia between 2 periods (period I, 1996-1999: extremely low birth weight, n = 122; extremely low gestational age, n = 118; period II, 2000-2003: extremely low birth weight, n = 109; extremely low gestational age, n = 107). RESULTS: For both groups, significant practice changes between period I and period II included increased prenatal and decreased postnatal steroid therapy and increased surfactant therapy, indomethacin therapy, and patent ductus arteriosus ligation. Significant morbidity changes included decreased rates of severe cranial ultrasound abnormalities and increased rates of ventilator dependence. Rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia did not change (52\% vs 53\%). Follow-up evaluation revealed significantly lower rates of neurosensory abnormalities during period II (extremely low birth weight: 29\% vs 16\%; extremely low gestational age: 31\% vs 16\%). There were no changes in rates of Mental Developmental Index scores of {$<$}70 (extremely low birth weight: 42\% vs 42\%; extremely low gestational age: 37\% vs 45\%) or overall developmental impairment (extremely low birth weight: 51\% vs 49\%; extremely low gestational age: 50\% vs 51\%). For the extremely low gestational age group, predictors of neurosensory abnormalities were severe cranial ultrasound abnormality and postnatal steroid therapy. Predictors of overall impairment included severe cranial ultrasound abnormalities, ventilator dependence, postnatal steroid therapy, and patent ductus arteriosus ligation. For the extremely low birth weight group, the only predictor of neurosensory abnormalities was severe cranial ultrasound abnormality. Predictors of overall impairment included multiple birth, ventilator dependence, and severe cranial ultrasound abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosensory outcomes of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia improved during 2000 to 2003 but overall neurodevelopmental outcomes did not change.},

  abstract = {Abstract Explosive blast-induced traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the signature insult in modern combat casualty care and has been linked to post-traumatic stress disorder, memory loss, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. In this article we report on blast-induced mild TBI (mTBI) characterized by fiber-tract degeneration and axonal injury revealed by cupric silver staining in adult male rats after head-only exposure to 35 psi in a helium-driven shock tube with head restraint. We now explore pathways of secondary injury and repair using biochemical/molecular strategies. Injury produced {$\sim$}25\% mortality from apnea. Shams received identical anesthesia exposure. Rats were sacrificed at 2 or 24 h, and brain was sampled in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Hippocampal samples were used to assess gene array (RatRef-12 Expression BeadChip; Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) and oxidative stress (OS; ascorbate, glutathione, low-molecular-weight thiols [LMWT], protein thiols, and 4-hydroxynonenal [HNE]). Cortical samples were used to assess neuroinflammation (cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors; Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) and purines (adenosine triphosphate [ATP], adenosine diphosphate, adenosine, inosine, 2'-AMP [adenosine monophosphate], and 5'-AMP). Gene array revealed marked increases in astrocyte and neuroinflammatory markers at 24 h (glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, and complement component 1) with expression patterns bioinformatically consistent with those noted in Alzheimer's disease and long-term potentiation. Ascorbate, LMWT, and protein thiols were reduced at 2 and 24 h; by 24 h, HNE was increased. At 2 h, multiple cytokines and chemokines (interleukin [IL]-1{$\alpha$}, IL-6, IL-10, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha [MIP-1{$\alpha$}]) were increased; by 24 h, only MIP-1{$\alpha$} remained elevated. ATP was not depleted, and adenosine correlated with 2'-cyclic AMP (cAMP), and not 5'-cAMP. Our data reveal (1) gene-array alterations similar to disorders of memory processing and a marked astrocyte response, (2) OS, (3) neuroinflammation with a sustained chemokine response, and (4) adenosine production despite lack of energy failure-possibly resulting from metabolism of 2'-3'-cAMP. A robust biochemical/molecular response occurs after blast-induced mTBI, with the body protected from blast and the head constrained to limit motion.},

  abstract = {Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, with mortality rates as high as 50\% in children with severe PARDS. Despite this, pediatric lung injury and mechanical ventilation has been poorly studied, with the majority of investigations being observational or retrospective and with only a few randomized controlled trials to guide intensivists. The most recent and universally accepted guidelines for pediatric lung injury are based on consensus opinion rather than objective data. Therefore, most neonatal and pediatric mechanical ventilation practices have been arbitrarily adapted from adult protocols, neglecting the differences in lung pathophysiology, response to injury, and co-morbidities among the three groups. Low tidal volume ventilation has been generally accepted for pediatric patients, even in the absence of supporting evidence. No target tidal volume range has consistently been associated with outcomes, and compliance with delivering specific tidal volume ranges has been poor. Similarly, optimal PEEP has not been well-studied, with a general acceptance of higher levels of F                                i                              O               2               and less aggressive PEEP titration as compared with adults. Other modes of ventilation including airway pressure release ventilation and high frequency ventilation have not been studied in a systematic fashion and there is too little evidence to recommend supporting or refraining from their use. There have been no consistent outcomes among studies in determining optimal modes or methods of setting them. In this review, the studies performed to date on mechanical ventilation strategies in neonatal and pediatric populations will be analyzed. There may not be a single optimal mechanical ventilation approach, where the best method may simply be one that allows for a personalized approach with settings adapted to the individual patient and disease pathophysiology. The challenges and barriers to conducting well-powered and robust multi-institutional studies will also be addressed, as well as reconsidering outcome measures and study design.},

  abstract = {Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe cognitive, social, and physical impairments resulting from de novo mutations in the X-chromosomal methyl-CpG binding protein gene 2 ( MECP2 ). While there is still no cure for RTT, exploring up-to date neurofunctional diagnostic markers, discovering new potential therapeutic targets, and searching for novel drug efficacy evaluation indicators are fundamental. Multiple neuroimaging studies on brain structure and function have been carried out in RTT-linked gene mutation carriers to unravel disease-specific imaging features and explore genotype-phenotype associations. Here, we reviewed the neuroimaging literature on this disorder. MRI morphologic studies have shown global atrophy of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) and regional variations in brain maturation. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have demonstrated reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in left peripheral WM areas, left major WM tracts, and cingulum bilaterally, and WM microstructural/network topology changes have been further found to be correlated with behavioral abnormalities in RTT. Cerebral blood perfusion imaging studies using single-photon emission CT (SPECT) or PET have evidenced a decreased global cerebral blood flow (CBF), particularly in prefrontal and temporoparietal areas, while magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and PET studies have contributed to unraveling metabolic alterations in patients with RTT. The results obtained from the available reports confirm that multimodal neuroimaging can provide new insights into a complex interplay between genes, neurotransmitter pathway abnormalities, disease-related behaviors, and clinical severity. However, common limitations related to the available studies include small sample sizes and hypothesis-based and region-specific approaches. We, therefore, conclude that this field is still in its early development phase and that multimodal/multisequence studies with improved post-processing technologies as well as combined PET--MRI approaches are urgently needed to further explore RTT brain alterations.},

Comparison of growth parameters derived from a sample of 161 normative male brains collected at the Department of Neuroanatomy of the Medical School in Hannover revealed an ideal weight of 1,353 g (SD = 14), a half value time of 401 (SD = 10) ontogenetic days and a growth factor of 4.0 (SD = 0.2). The minor discrepancies in the corresponding parameters reflect the small sample size and a considerable lack of developmental data of the three first postnatal decades in the material derived from the Yakovlev Collection. It was, therefore, deemed necessary to analyze these data in combination with data derived from other sources of human material. A comparison of human with animal growth parameters derived from mice, cats and tree shrews reveals differences in brain development. Histological shrinkage of the 25 male brains of the Yakovlev Collection related to fixation, embedding, and staining was assessed. Fetal brains shrank by about 75\%, and adult brains by about 50\%. The degree of shrinkage was inversely proportional to the age of the brain and was also characterized by individual variations of up to 20\%. Therefore, shrinkage had to be corrected on an individual basis in order to determine the true growth of brain regions as reflected by morphometric analysis of histological serial sections.},

The present study aims to develop a non-invasive, rapid, and reproducible method to measure Yv in a vessel-specific manner. Theory The method, T2-Relaxation-Under-Phase-Contrast (TRU-PC) MRI, utilizes complex subtraction of phase-contrast to isolate pure blood signal, applies non-slice-selective T2-preparation to measure T2, and converts T2 to oxygenation using a calibration plot. Methods Following feasibility demonstration, several technical aspects were examined, including validation with an established global Yv technique, test-retest reproducibility, sensitivity to detect oxygenation changes due to hypoxia and caffeine challenges, applicability of EPI acquisition to shorten scan duration, and ability to study veins with a caliber of 1--2 mm. Results TRU-PC was able to simultaneously measure Yv in all major veins in the brain, including sagittal sinus, straight sinus, great vein, and internal cerebral vein. TRU-PC results showed an excellent agreement with the reference technique, high sensitivity to oxygenation changes, and test-retest variability of 3.5\textpm 1.0\%. The use of segmented-EPI was able to reduce the scan duration to 1.5 minutes. It was also feasible to study pial veins and deep veins. Conclusion TRU-PC MRI is a promising technique for vessel-specific oxygenation measurement.},

QSM images were created using the morphology-enabled dipole inversion method, and OEF maps were generated from QSM images using extraction of venous susceptibility induced by deoxygenated hemoglobin. Significant correlation of relative OEF ratio to contra-lateral hemisphere between QSM--OEF and PET--OEF was observed (r\,=\,0.62, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). The local (intra-section) correlation was also significant (r\,=\,0.52, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) in patients with increased PET--OEF. The sensitivity and specificity of OEF increase in QSM was 0.63 (5/8) and 0.89 (16/18), respectively, in comparison with PET.

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can occur anywhere along the cortical mantel. While the cortical contusions may be random and disparate in their locations, the clinical outcomes are often similar and difficult to explain. Thus a question that arises is, do concussions at different sites on the cortex affect similar subcortical brain regions? To address this question we used a fluid percussion model to concuss the right caudal or rostral cortices in rats. Five days later, diffusion tensor MRI data were acquired for indices of anisotropy (IA) for use in a novel method of analysis to detect changes in gray matter microarchitecture. IA values from over 20,000 voxels were registered into a 3D segmented, annotated rat atlas covering 150 brain areas. Comparisons between left and right hemispheres revealed a small population of subcortical sites with altered IA values. Rostral and caudal concussions were of striking similarity in the impacted subcortical locations, particularly the central nucleus of the amygdala, laterodorsal thalamus, and hippocampal complex. Subsequent immunohistochemical analysis of these sites showed significant neuroinflammation. This study presents three significant findings that advance our understanding and evaluation of TBI: 1) the introduction of a new method to identify highly localized disturbances in discrete gray matter, subcortical brain nuclei without postmortem histology, 2) the use of this method to demonstrate that separate injuries to the rostral and caudal cortex produce the same subcortical, disturbances, and 3) the central nucleus of the amygdala, critical in the regulation of emotion, is vulnerable to concussion.},

  abstract = {The default mode network (DMN) comprises a set of regions that exhibit ongoing, intrinsic activity in the resting state and task-related decreases in activity across a range of paradigms. However, DMN regions have also been reported as task-related increases, either independently or coactivated with other regions in the network. Cognitive subtractions and the use of low-level baseline conditions have generally masked the functional nature of these regions. Using a combination of activation likelihood estimation, which assesses statistically significant convergence of neuroimaging results, and tools distributed with the BrainMap database, we identified core regions in the DMN and examined their functional heterogeneity. Meta-analytic coactivation maps of task-related increases were independently generated for each region, which included both within-DMN and non-DMN connections. Their functional properties were assessed using behavioral domain metadata in BrainMap. These results were integrated to determine a DMN connectivity model that represents the patterns of interactions observed in task-related increases in activity across diverse tasks. Subnetwork components of this model were identified, and behavioral domain analysis of these cliques yielded discrete functional properties, demonstrating that components of the DMN are differentially specialized. Affective and perceptual cliques of the DMN were identified, as well as the cliques associated with a reduced preference for motor processing. In summary, we used advanced coordinate-based meta-analysis techniques to explicate behavior and connectivity in the default mode network; future work will involve applying this analysis strategy to other modes of brain function, such as executive function or sensorimotor systems.},

PET allows for the three-dimensional mapping of administered positron-emitting radiopharmaceuticals such as 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (for imaging glucose metabolism). PET enables the study of biologic function in both health and disease, in contrast to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), that are more suited to study a body's morphologic changes, although functional MRI can also be used to study certain brain functions by measuring blood flow changes during task performance. This chapter first provides an overview of the basic physics principles and instrumentation behind PET methodology, with an introduction to the merits of merging functional PET imaging with anatomic CT or MRI imaging. We then focus on clinical neurologic disorders, and reference research on relevant PET radiopharmaceuticals when applicable. We then provide an overview of PET scan interpretation and findings in several specific neurologic disorders such as dementias, epilepsy, movement disorders, infection, cerebrovascular disorders, and brain tumors.},

Diffusion MRI is a versatile technique to study white matter injury following SRC, yet serial follow-up studies in the very acute stages following SRC utilizing a comprehensive set of diffusion metrics are lacking. The aim of the current study was to characterize white matter changes within 24 hours of concussion in a group of high school and collegiate athletes, using Diffusion Tensor and Diffusion Kurtosis Tensor metrics. Participants were reassessed a week later. At 24 hours post-injury, the concussed group reported significantly more concussion symptoms than a well-matched control group and demonstrated poorer performance on a cognitive screening measure, yet these differences were nonsignificant at the 8-day follow-up. Similarly, within 24-hours after injury, the concussed group exhibited a widespread decrease in mean diffusivity, increased axial kurtosis and, to a lesser extent, decreased axial and radial diffusivities compared with control subjects. At 8 days post injury, the differences in these diffusion metrics were even more widespread in the injured athletes, despite improvement of symptoms and cognitive performance. These MRI findings suggest that the athletes might not have reached full physiological recovery a week after the injury. These findings have significant implications for the management of SRC because allowing an athlete to return to play before the brain has fully recovered from injury may have negative consequences.

  abstract = {Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a novel technique which allows determining the bulk magnetic susceptibility distribution of tissue in vivo from gradient echo magnetic resonance phase images. It is commonly assumed that paramagnetic iron is the predominant source of susceptibility variations in gray matter as many studies have reported a reasonable correlation of magnetic susceptibility with brain iron concentrations in vivo. Instead of performing direct comparisons, however, all these studies used the putative iron concentrations reported in the hallmark study by Hallgren and Sourander (1958) for their analysis. Consequently, the extent to which QSM can serve to reliably assess brain iron levels is not yet fully clear. To provide such information we investigated the relation between bulk tissue magnetic susceptibility and brain iron concentration in unfixed (in situ) post mortem brains of 13 subjects using MRI and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. A strong linear correlation between chemically determined iron concentration and bulk magnetic susceptibility was found in gray matter structures (r=0.84, p{$<$}0.001), whereas the correlation coefficient was much lower in white matter (r=0.27, p{$<$}0.001). The slope of the overall linear correlation was consistent with theoretical considerations of the magnetism of ferritin supporting that most of the iron in the brain is bound to ferritin proteins. In conclusion, iron is the dominant source of magnetic susceptibility in deep gray matter and can be assessed with QSM. In white matter regions the estimation of iron concentrations by QSM is less accurate and more complex because the counteracting contribution from diamagnetic myelinated neuronal fibers confounds the interpretation.},

METHODS: Gradient-echo images of a healthy volunteer acquired at 3T in a single orientation with 1.06\,mm isotropic resolution. A reference susceptibility map was provided, which was computed using the susceptibility tensor imaging algorithm on data acquired at 12 head orientations. Susceptibility maps calculated from the single orientation data were compared against the reference susceptibility map. Deviations were quantified using the following metrics: root mean squared error (RMSE), structure similarity index (SSIM), high-frequency error norm (HFEN), and the error in selected white and gray matter regions. RESULTS: Twenty-seven submissions were evaluated. Most of the best scoring approaches estimated the spatial frequency content in the ill-conditioned domain of the dipole kernel using compressed sensing strategies. The top 10 maps in each category had similar error metrics but substantially different visual appearance. CONCLUSION: Because QSM algorithms were optimized to minimize error metrics, the resulting susceptibility maps suffered from over-smoothing and conspicuity loss in fine features such as vessels. As such, the challenge highlighted the need for better numerical image quality criteria. Magn Reson Med, 2017. \copyright{} 2017 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.},

  abstract = {MR phase images have shown significantly improved contrast between cortical gray and white matter regions compared to magnitude images obtained with gradient echo sequences. A variety of underlying biophysical mechanisms (including iron, blood, myelin content, macromolecular chemical exchange, and fiber orientation) have been suggested to account for this observation but assessing the individual contribution of these factors is limited in vivo. For a closer investigation of iron and myelin induced susceptibility changes, postmortem MRI of six human corpses (age range at death: 56-80 years) was acquired in situ. Following autopsy, the iron concentrations in the frontal and occipital cortex as well as in white matter regions were chemically determined. The magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) was used as an indirect measure for myelin content. Susceptibility effects were assessed separately by determining R2* relaxation rates and quantitative phase shifts. Contributions of myelin and iron to local variations of the susceptibility were assessed by univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis. Mean iron concentration was lower in the frontal cortex than in frontal white matter (26 \textpm{} 6 vs. 45 \textpm{} 6 mg/kg wet tissue) while an inverse relation was found in the occipital lobe (cortical gray matter: 41 \textpm{} 10 vs. white matter: 34 \textpm{} 10mg/kg wet tissue). Multiple regression analysis revealed iron and MTR as independent predictors of the effective transverse relaxation rate R2 but solely MTR was identified as source of MR phase contrast. R2 was correlated with iron concentrations in cortical gray matter only (r=0.42, p{$<$}0.05). In conclusion, MR phase contrast between cortical gray and white matter can be mainly attributed to variations in myelin content, but not to iron concentration. Both, myelin and iron impact the effective transverse relaxation rate R2 significantly. Magnitude contrast is limited because it only reflects the extent but not the direction of the susceptibility shift.},

  abstract = {Computations are dynamical systems. The formal study of dynamical systems has revealed a spectrum of behaviors ranging from fixed-point dynamics to fully developed chaos. How does computation--especially universal computation--fit into this spectrum of dynamical behaviors? This thesis addresses the question via the study of Cellular Automata (CA). CA are discrete space/time dynamical systems which (a) exhibit the full spectrum of dynamical behaviors, and (b) are known to support universal computation. Therefore, if we can locate the CA which support computation in the full spectrum of CA dynamics, we may learn a great deal about the general relationship between computation and dynamics. We find that, with an appropriate parameterization of the space of CA, we can order CA dynamical behaviors from fixed-point, through periodic, to chaotic behavior. We also find that there exists a phase-transition in this sequence, located between the periodic and the chaotic rules. The dynamics in the vicinity of this phase-transition are the most complex exhibited anywhere in the spectrum, both qualitatively and quantitatively. These "complex" rules exhibit many of the properties deemed necessary to support computation, and therefore we are able to identify computation with a phase-transition in the space of CA. We are also able to explain the existence of--and relationships between--previously suggested classes of CA behavior (such as the four Wolfram classes) in terms of this phase-transition in the space of CA. The results reported here suggest a general relationship between computation and phase-transitions, especially second-order phase-transitions. When viewed from this perspective, one is able to explain a great deal of the phenomenology of computation, such as the existence of complexity classes, computability classes, and the Halting problem. This view also leads to some new suggestions about the nature and origin of such complex natural phenomena as Life and Intelligence.},

  abstract = {Objective. Severe abnormalities of the head ultrasound (HUS) are important predictors of cerebral palsy (CP) and mental retardation, and a normal HUS usually ensures the absence of major impairments. With the increasing survival of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (birth weight \&lt;1000 g), the prognostic significance of a normal HUS may differ. This study examined the prevalence of and risk factors for CP and impaired mental development among ELBW infants with a normal HUS.             Methods. Study infants were ELBW infants who were cared for in Neonatal Research Network centers in the years 1995--1999, had a normal early and late HUS, survived to discharge, and returned for follow-up assessments at 18 to 22 months' corrected age. The outcomes of interest were a score \&lt;70 on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II Mental Developmental Index (MDI) and CP. Risk factors included maternal demographics; infant characteristics; and interventions or morbidities related to the lung, infection, and nutrition. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). A time-oriented approach was used to select variables for inclusion in logistic models.             Results. Of 1749 infants with a normal early and late HUS (performed at a mean age of 6 and 47 days, respectively), 1473 (84\%) returned for follow-up assessment. Infants had a birth weight of 792 \textpm{} 134 g (mean \textpm{} SD) and gestational age of 26 \textpm{} 2 weeks. Rates of CP and MDI \&lt;70 were 9.4\% and 25.3\%, respectively, and 29.2\% of infants had either CP or MDI \&lt;70. In multivariate analyses, factors associated with CP were male gender (OR: 1.8; 95\% CI: 1.2--2.6), multiple birth, (OR: 1.6; 95\% CI: 1.1--2.5), decreasing birth weight (OR: 1.3 for each 100-g decrease; 95\% CI: 1.1--1.5), pneumothorax (OR: 2.3; 95\% CI: 1.2--4.4), and days of conventional ventilation (OR: 1.2 for each additional 10 days; 95\% CI: 1.1--1.3). With the exception of pneumothorax, these same factors were associated with MDI \&lt;70, in addition to less maternal education (OR: 1.4; 95\% CI: 1.0--1.9) and Medicaid or lack of coverage for maternal insurance (OR: 1.7; 95\% CI: 1.2--2.4).             Conclusions. Nearly 30\% of ELBW infants with a normal HUS had either CP or a low MDI. Risk factors that are associated with this high rate of adverse outcomes include pneumothorax, prolonged exposure to mechanical ventilation, and educational and economic disadvantage. Improvements in pulmonary care to reduce duration of ventilation and avoid air leaks might improve neurodevelopmental outcome for ELBW infants.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing survival rates of children who are born very preterm raise issues about the risks of neurological disabilities and cognitive dysfunction. We aimed to investigate neurodevelopmental outcome and use of special health care at 5 years of age in a population-based cohort of very preterm children. METHODS: We included all 2901 livebirths between 22 and 32 completed weeks of gestation from nine regions in France in Jan 1-Dec 31, 1997, and a reference group of 667 children from the same regions born at 39-40 weeks of gestation. At 5 years of age, children had a medical examination and a cognitive assessment with the Kaufman assessment battery for children (K-ABC), with scores on the mental processing composite (MPC) scale recorded. Data for health-care use were collected from parents. Severe disability was defined as non-ambulatory cerebral palsy, MPC score less than 55, or severe visual or hearing deficiency; moderate deficiency as cerebral palsy walking with aid or MPC score of 55-69; and minor disability as cerebral palsy walking without aid, MPC score of 70-84, or visual deficit ({$<$}3/10 for one eye). FINDINGS: In total, 1817 (77\%) of the 2357 surviving children born very preterm had a medical assessment at 5 years and 396 (60\%) of 664 in the reference group. Cerebral palsy was diagnosed in 159 (9\%) of children born very preterm. Scores for MPC were available for 1534 children born very preterm: 503 (32\%) had an MPC score less than 85 and 182 (12\%) had an MPC score less than 70. Of the 320 children in the reference group, the corresponding values were 37 (12\%) and 11 (3\%), respectively. In the very preterm group, 83 (5\%) had severe disability, 155 (9\%) moderate disability, and 398 (25\%) minor disability. Disability was highest in children born at 24-28 completed weeks of gestation (195 children [49\%]), but the absolute number of children with disabilities was higher for children born at 29-32 weeks (441 children [36\%]). Special health-care resources were used by 188 (42\%) of children born at 24-28 weeks and 424 (31\%) born at 29-32 weeks, compared with only 63 (16\%) of those born at 39-40 weeks. INTERPRETATION: In children who are born very preterm, cognitive and neuromotor impairments at 5 years of age increase with decreasing gestational age. Many of these children need a high level of specialised care. Prevention of the learning disabilities associated with cognitive deficiencies in this group is an important goal for modern perinatal care for children who are born very preterm and for their families.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Loss of myelin in the spinal cord in multiple sclerosis (MS) is likely an important, and early, contributor to atrophy and associated disability. In vivo measurement of myelin is possible using myelin water fraction (MWF) imaging, but MWF has never been assessed in MS along the entire length of the spinal cord in vivo or in post-mortem tissue. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of measuring the distribution of MWF along the entire length of the spinal cord in post-mortem MS tissue using high-field MRI. METHODS: One formalin-fixed spinal cord from a female with secondary progressive MS (age: 78 years, disease duration: 25 years) was cut into 104 5-mm-thick cross sections along the entire length of the spinal cord from the cervico-medullary junction to the conus medullaris and imaged using a 64 echo T2 relaxation experiment at 7T. RESULTS: Myelin water maps showed cord anatomy in superb detail, white matter demonstrating a higher MWF than the grey matter. Anatomical variation in myelin distribution along cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions was observed. Lesions demonstrated myelin loss. CONCLUSION: Post-mortem myelin water imaging of formalin-fixed MS spinal cord is feasible.},

The multi-component T2 distribution of water was determined from 25 formalin-fixed MS brain samples using a multi-echo T2 relaxation MR experiment. The myelin water fraction (MWF), defined as T2 signal below 30 milliseconds divided by the total signal, was determined for various regions of interest and compared to Luxol fast blue (myelin stain) mean optical density (OD) for each sample. MWF had a strong correlation with myelin stain [mean (range) R2 = 0.67 (0.45-0.92)], validating MWF as a measure of myelin density. This quantitative technique has many practical applications for the in vivo monitoring of demyelination and remyelination in a variety of disorders of myelin.},

Recently, a number of investigators have performed MWI at field strengths higher than 1.5 T. Our goal was to determine if myelin water imaging at increased SNR, arising from the use of a small bore 7 T MR system with optimized coil geometry, enables the production of superior myelin water maps with increased spatial detail and enables better correlations with histology. Ten formalin-fixed MS brain samples underwent a 32-echo T(2) relaxation experiment which measured myelin water fraction (MWF) on a 7-T animal MRI scanner. MWF correlated strongly qualitatively and quantitatively with luxol fast blue staining for myelin [mean (range): R(2)=0.78 (0.56-0.95), p{$<$}0.0001]. The quality and detail of 7 T myelin water maps were far superior to that previously seen at 1.5 T, allowing for visualization of fine structures such as the normal prominent myelination of the deeper cortical layers, the alveus of the hippocampus and rings of preserved myelin in a concentric Balo's lesion. 7 T imaging will allow detailed assessment of myelin pathology to a degree not possible with lower field strengths.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This is the first of seven articles from a preterm birth and stillbirth report. Presented here is an overview of the burden, an assessment of the quality of current estimates, review of trends, and recommendations to improve data. PRETERM BIRTH: Few countries have reliable national preterm birth prevalence data. Globally, an estimated 13 million babies are born before 37 completed weeks of gestation annually. Rates are generally highest in low- and middle-income countries, and increasing in some middle- and high-income countries, particularly the Americas. Preterm birth is the leading direct cause of neonatal death (27\%); more than one million preterm newborns die annually. Preterm birth is also the dominant risk factor for neonatal mortality, particularly for deaths due to infections. Long-term impairment is an increasing issue. STILLBIRTH: Stillbirths are currently not included in Millennium Development Goal tracking and remain invisible in global policies. For international comparisons, stillbirths include late fetal deaths weighing more than 1000g or occurring after 28 weeks gestation. Only about 2\% of all stillbirths are counted through vital registration and global estimates are based on household surveys or modelling. Two global estimation exercises reached a similar estimate of around three million annually; 99\% occur in low- and middle-income countries. One million stillbirths occur during birth. Global stillbirth cause-of-death estimates are impeded by multiple, complex classification systems. RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE DATA: (1) increase the capture and quality of pregnancy outcome data through household surveys, the main data source for countries with 75\% of the global burden; (2) increase compliance with standard definitions of gestational age and stillbirth in routine data collection systems; (3) strengthen existing data collection mechanisms--especially vital registration and facility data--by instituting a standard death certificate for stillbirth and neonatal death linked to revised International Classification of Diseases coding; (4) validate a simple, standardized classification system for stillbirth cause-of-death; and (5) improve systems and tools to capture acute morbidity and long-term impairment outcomes following preterm birth. CONCLUSION: Lack of adequate data hampers visibility, effective policies, and research. Immediate opportunities exist to improve data tracking and reduce the burden of preterm birth and stillbirth.},

However, the extent of these neuroanatomical deficits and the relation among these measures in middle childhood, a critical developmental period, have not been determined. We assessed differences in brain structure by acquiring high-resolution T(1)-weighted scans in 25 children born very preterm ({$<$}32 weeks gestational age) without significant post-natal neurological sequelae and 32 age-matched term-born children (7-10 years). Children born very preterm had decreased brain volume, surface area and cortical thickness compared to term-born children. Furthermore, children born preterm did not display the robust relation between total brain volume and basal ganglia and thalamic volume apparent in the term-born children. Cortical thickness analyses revealed that the cortex was thinner for children born preterm than term-born children in the anterior cingulate cortex/supplementary motor area, isthmus of the cingulate gyrus, right superior temporal sulcus, right anterior insula, postcentral gyrus and precuneus. Follow-up analyses revealed that right precuneus thickness was correlated with gestational age. Thus, even without significant postnatal medical sequelae, very preterm-born children showed atypical brain structure and developmental patterns in areas related to higher cognitive function. Disruptions of the typical neurodevelopmental trajectory in the third trimester of pregnancy likely underlie these differences persisting into middle childhood.},

As diffusion is truly a three-dimensional process, molecular mobility in tissues may be anisotropic, as in brain white matter. With diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion anisotropy effects can be fully extracted, characterized, and exploited, providing even more exquisite details on tissue microstructure. The most advanced application is certainly that of fiber tracking in the brain, which, in combination with functional MRI, might open a window on the important issue of connectivity. DTI has also been used to demonstrate subtle abnormalities in a variety of diseases (including stroke, multiple sclerosis, dyslexia, and schizophrenia) and is currently becoming part of many routine clinical protocols. The aim of this article is to review the concepts behind DTI and to present potential applications.},

The observed contrast has been attributed in part to local variations in magnetic susceptibility arising from iron in storage proteins and tissue lipid. Another contribution could come from the paramagnetic blood constituent deoxy-hemoglobin, the tissue concentration of which may vary through local variations in vascular density. To investigate this possibility, we examined phase contrast between gray and white matter in rats after intravenous administration of a superparamagnetic contrast agent at various dosages. At the maximum dosage (3 mg Fe/kg), which resulted in an estimated paramagnetic susceptibility shift 4-8 times larger than deoxy-hemoglobin, we observed a negligible increase in phase contrast between gray and white matter. This result suggests that endogenous deoxy-hemoglobin has no significant contribution to phase contrast between gray and white matter.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in high-field ({$>$}or=7 T) MRI have made it possible to study the fine structure of the human brain at the level of fiber bundles and cortical layers. In particular, techniques aimed at detecting MRI resonance frequency shifts originating from local variation in magnetic susceptibility and other sources have greatly improved the visualization of these structures. A recent theoretical study [He X, Yablonskiy DA (2009) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 106:13558-13563] suggests that MRI resonance frequency may report not only on tissue composition, but also on microscopic compartmentalization of susceptibility inclusions and their orientation relative to the magnetic field. The proposed sensitivity to tissue structure may greatly expand the information available with conventional MRI techniques. To investigate this possibility, we studied postmortem tissue samples from human corpus callosum with an experimental design that allowed separation of microstructural effects from confounding macrostructural effects. The results show that MRI resonance frequency does depend on microstructural orientation. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of the resonance frequency shift suggests an origin related to anisotropic susceptibility effects rather than microscopic compartmentalization. This anisotropy, which has been shown to depend on molecular ordering, may provide valuable information about tissue molecular structure.},

  abstract = {In MRI, researchers have long endeavored to effectively visualize myelin distribution in the brain, a pursuit with significant implications for both scientific research and clinical applications. Over time, various methods such as myelin water imaging, magnetization transfer imaging, and relaxometric imaging have been developed, each carrying distinct advantages and limitations. Recently, an innovative technique named as magnetic susceptibility source separation has emerged, introducing a novel surrogate biomarker for myelin in the form of a diamagnetic susceptibility map. This paper comprehensively reviews this cutting-edge method, providing the fundamental concepts of magnetic susceptibility, susceptibility imaging, and the validation of the diamagnetic susceptibility map as a myelin biomarker that indirectly measures myelin content. Additionally, the paper explores essential aspects of data acquisition and processing, offering practical insights for readers. A comparison with established myelin imaging methods is also presented, and both current and prospective clinical and scientific applications are discussed to provide a holistic understanding of the technique. This work aims to serve as a foundational resource for newcomers entering this dynamic and rapidly expanding field.},

We find that the edge of chaos predicts quite well those values of circuit parameters that yield maximal computational performance. But obviously it makes no prediction of their computational performance for other parameter values. Therefore, we propose a new method for predicting the computational performance of neural microcircuit models. The new measure estimates directly the kernel property and the generalization capability of a neural microcircuit. We validate the proposed measure by comparing its prediction with direct evaluations of the computational performance of various neural microcircuit models. The proposed method also allows us to quantify differences in the computational performance and generalization capability of neural circuits in different dynamic regimes (UP- and DOWN-states) that have been demonstrated through intracellular recordings in vivo.},

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with various neurocognitive deficits, and rapid assessment of the damage is potentially important for the prevention and treatment of these deficits. Imaging assessment of mild or moderate damage outside the primary lesion area after TBI, however, remains challenging. Magnetization transfer (MT) has clearly been underutilized in imaging the damage caused by TBI. Here, we applied the MT ratio (MTR) using sweep imaging with Fourier transformation (SWIFT) to study microstructural tissue damage in the thalamocortical pathway outside the primary lesion in a lateral fluid percussion injury rat model of TBI, 5~months after injury. MTR was decreased in layers VIb-IV of the barrel cortex and related subcortical areas, mainly indicating demyelination, which was verified by histology. The largest MTR change in the cortex was in layer VIb (-8.2\%, pFDR ~=~0.01), and the largest MTR change in the subcortical areas was in the caudal-most portion of the internal capsule (-11.0\%, pFDR ~{$<~$}0.005). These areas exhibited the greatest demyelination and substantial cellularity attributed to gliosis. Correlation analysis of group-averaged results from the subcortical areas revealed an excellent correlation of MTR with myelin (r(2) ~=~0.94, p~{$<~$}0.001), but no correlation with increased cellularity as detected by Nissl staining. Thus, MTR using SWIFT can be a valuable tool for the assessment of subtle changes after TBI in both cortical and subcortical areas.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the relationship of gestational age (GA) with brain volumes and cognitive functions is linear or whether it follows a threshold model in preterm and term born children during school-age. STUDY DESIGN: We studied 106 children (M = 10 years 1 month, SD = 16 months; 40 females) enrolled in primary school: 57 were healthy very preterm children (10 children born 24-27 completed weeks' gestation (extremely preterm), 14 children born 28-29 completed weeks' gestation, 19 children born 30-31 completed weeks' gestation (very preterm), and 14 born 32 completed weeks' gestation (moderately preterm)) all born appropriate for GA (AGA) and 49 term-born children. Neuroimaging involved voxel-based morphometry with the statistical parametric mapping software. Cognitive functions were assessed with the WISC-IV. General Linear Models and multiple regressions were conducted controlling age, sex, and maternal education. RESULTS: Compared to groups of children born 30 completed weeks' gestation and later, children born {$<$}28 completed weeks' gestation had less gray matter volume (GMV) and white matter volume (WMV) and poorer cognitive functions including decreased full scale IQ, and processing speed. Differences in GMV partially mediated the relationship between GA and full scale IQ in preterm born children. CONCLUSIONS: In preterm children who are born AGA and without major complications GA is associated with brain volume and cognitive functions. In particular, decreased brain volume becomes evident in the extremely preterm group (born {$<$}28 completed weeks' gestation). In preterm children born 30 completed weeks' gestation and later the relationship of GA with brain volume and cognitive functions may be less strong as previously thought.},

In particular, it can be used to examine, recognize and compare different states of brain consciousness such as sleep, wakefulness or general anesthesia. Yet, during rapid eye movement sleep (the sleep phase in which dreaming occurs), the electrical activity of the brain is similar to the one recorded during wakefulness, making it difficult to distinguish these states based on EEG alone. EEG records brain activity in the shape of rhythmic waves whose frequency, shape and amplitude vary depending on the state of consciousness. In the EEG signal from the human brain, the higher frequency waves are weaker than the low-frequency waves: a measure known as spectral slope reflects the degree of this difference in the signal strength. Previous research suggests that spectral slope can be used to distinguish wakefulness from anesthesia and non-REM sleep. Here, Lendner et al. explored whether certain elements of the spectral slope could also discern wakefulness from all states of reduced arousal. EEG readings were taken from patients and volunteers who were awake, asleep or under anesthesia, using electrodes placed either on the scalp or into the brain. Lendner et al. found that the spectral slope could distinguish wakefulness from anesthesia, deep non-REM and REM sleep. The changes in the spectral slope during sleep could accurately track the degree of arousal with great temporal precision and across a wide range of time scales. This method means that states of consciousness can be spotted just from a scalp EEG. In the future, this approach could be embedded into the techniques used for monitoring sleep or anesthesia during operations; it could also be harnessed to monitor other low-response states, such as comas.},

These sources were supplemented with data from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Cortical dysplasia is the most frequent histopathologic substrate in children, and the second most common etiology in adult epilepsy surgery patients. Cortical dysplasia patients present with seizures at an earlier age than other surgically treated etiologies, and 33-50\% have nonlocalized scalp EEG and normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. 2-((18)F)Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is positive in 75-90\% of cases. After complete resection, 80\% of patients are seizure free compared with 20\% with incomplete resections. Compared with type I, patients with type II cortical dysplasia present at younger ages, have higher seizure frequencies, and are extratemporal. Type I dysplasia is found more often in adult patients in the temporal lobe and is often MRI negative. These findings identify characteristics of patients with mild and severe cortical dysplasia that define surgically treated epilepsy syndromes. The authors discuss future challenges to identifying and treating medically refractory epilepsy patients with cortical dysplasia.},

Prominent examples of self-organized critical dynamics include piling of granular media2, plate tectonics3 and stick--slip motion4. Critical behaviour has been shown to bring about optimal computational capabilities5, optimal transmission6, storage of information7 and sensitivity to sensory stimuli8,9,10. In neuronal systems, the existence of critical avalanches was predicted11 and later observed experimentally6,12,13. However, whereas in the experiments generic critical avalanches were found, in the model of ref.11 they only show up if the set of parameters is fine-tuned externally to a critical transition state. Here, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that by assuming (biologically more realistic) dynamical synapses14 in a spiking neural network, the neuronal avalanches turn from an exceptional phenomenon into a typical and robust self-organized critical behaviour, if the total resources of neurotransmitter are sufficiently large.},

At baseline 40 patients had intracranial hyperintensities detected by MRI which predominated in the frontal and temporal regions, whereas 10 patients had lesions detected by CT. Neurobehavioural data obtained during the first admission to hospital disclosed no distinctive pattern in subgroups of patients characterised by lesions confined to the frontal, temporal, or frontotemporal regions, whereas all three groups exhibited pervasive deficits in relation to normal control subjects. The size of extraparenchymal lesion was significantly related to the initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, whereas this relation was not present in parenchymal lesions. One and three month follow up MRI findings showed substantial resolution of lesion while neuropsychological data reflected impressive recovery. The follow up data disclosed a trend from pervasive deficits to more specific impairments which were inconsistently related to the site of brain lesion. These results corroborate and extend previous findings, indicating that intracranial lesions detected by MRI are present in most patients hospitalised after mild to moderate CHI. Individual differences in the relation between site of lesion and the pattern of neuropsychological findings, which persist over one to three months after mild to moderate CHI, remain unexplained.},

Individual neurons spike irregularly, which is believed to originate from receiving balanced amounts of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, known as the excitation--inhibition balance. The spatial-temporal cascades of clustered neuronal spikes occur in variable sizes and durations, manifested as neural avalanches with scale-free features. These may be explained by the neural criticality hypothesis, which posits that neural systems operate around the transition between distinct dynamic states. Here, we summarize the experimental evidence for and the underlying theory of excitation--inhibition balance and neural criticality. Furthermore, we review recent studies of excitatory--inhibitory networks with synaptic kinetics as a simple solution to reconcile these two apparently distinct theories in a single circuit model. This provides a more unified understanding of multilevel neural activities in local circuits, from spontaneous to stimulus-response dynamics.},

Previous studies have demonstrated gray matter loss in chronic smokers. However, only a few studies assessed the changes of white matter integrity in this group. Based on those previous reports of alterations in white matter integrity in smokers, the aim of this study was to examine the alteration of white matter integrity in a large, well-matched sample of chronic smokers and non-smokers. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using in vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to measure the differences of whole-brain white matter integrity between 44 chronic smoking subjects (mean age, 28.0\textpm 5.6 years) and 44 healthy age- and sex-matched comparison non-smoking volunteers (mean age, 26.3\textpm 5.8 years). DTI was performed on a 3-Tesla Siemens scanner (Allegra; Siemens Medical System). The data revealed that smokers had higher fractional anisotropy (FA) than healthy non-smokers in almost symmetrically bilateral fronto-parietal tracts consisting of a major white matter pathway, the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: We found the almost symmetrically bilateral fronto-parietal whiter matter changes in a relatively large sample of chronic smokers. These findings support the hypothesis that chronic cigarette smoking involves alterations of bilateral fronto-parietal connectivity.},

Formalin-fixed brain tissue specimens were also studied using T(2)*-weighted MRI, histologic staining, chemical analysis, and electron microscopy. We found that T(2)* relaxation rate (R(2)* = 1/T(2)*) in white matter in living human brain is linearly dependent on the main magnetic field strength, and the T(2)* heterogeneity in white matter observed at 7.0 T can also be detected, albeit more weakly, at 1.5 and 3.0 T. The T(2)* heterogeneity exists also in white matter of the formalin-fixed brain tissue specimens, with prominent differences between the major fiber bundles such as the cingulum (CG) and the superior corona radiata. The white matter specimen with substantial difference in T(2)* has no significant difference in the total iron content, as determined by chemical analysis. On the other hand, evidence from histologic staining and electron microscopy demonstrates these tissue specimens have apparent difference in myelin content and microstructure.},

  abstract = {As indicated by several recent studies, magnetic susceptibility of the brain is influenced mainly by myelin in the white matter and by iron deposits in the deep nuclei. Myelination and iron deposition in the brain evolve both spatially and temporally. This evolution reflects an important characteristic of normal brain development and ageing. In this study, we assessed the changes of regional susceptibility in the human brain in vivo by examining the developmental and ageing process from 1 to 83 years of age. The evolution of magnetic susceptibility over this lifespan was found to display differential trajectories between the gray and the white matter. In both cortical and subcortical white matter, an initial decrease followed by a subsequent increase in magnetic susceptibility was observed, which could be fitted by a Poisson curve. In the gray matter, including the cortical gray matter and the iron-rich deep nuclei, magnetic susceptibility displayed a monotonic increase that can be described by an exponential growth. The rate of change varied according to functional and anatomical regions of the brain. For the brain nuclei, the age-related changes of susceptibility were in good agreement with the findings from R2* measurement. Our results suggest that magnetic susceptibility may provide valuable information regarding the spatial and temporal patterns of brain myelination and iron deposition during brain maturation and ageing.},

Male Wistar rats (300-350g, n\,=\,30) were subjected to controlled cortical impact TBI. At 6\,h or 1 week post-injury, these rats were intravenously injected with 1\,mL of saline (at 6\,h or 1 week, n\,=\,5/group) or with hMSCs in suspension ({$\sim$}3\,\texttimes\,10(6) hMSCs, at 6\,h or 1 week, n\,=\,10/group). In vivo MRI measurements and sensorimotor function estimates were performed on all animals pre-injury, 1 day post-injury, and weekly for 3 weeks post-injury. Bielschowsky's silver and Luxol fast blue staining were used to reveal the axon and myelin status, respectively, with and without cell treatment after TBI. Based on image data and histological observation, regions of interest encompassing the structural alterations were made and the values of FA and entropy were monitored in these specific brain regions. Our data demonstrate that administration of hMSCs after TBI leads to enhanced white matter reorganization particularly along the boundary of contusional lesion, which can be identified by both FA and entropy. Compared with the therapy performed at 1 week post-TBI, cell intervention executed at 6\,h expedites the brain remodeling process and results in an earlier functional recovery. Although FA and entropy present a similar capacity to dynamically detect the microstructural changes in the tissue regions with predominant orientation of fiber tracts, entropy exhibits a sensitivity superior to that of FA, in probing the structural alterations in the tissue areas with complex fiber patterns.},

Rett syndrome (RTT), a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 1:10,000--15,000 women globally, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the               Methyl-CpG-binding Protein-2               (               Mecp2               ) gene.

E/I balance in RTT is not homogeneously altered but demonstrates brain region and cell type specificity instead. In this review, I elaborate on the current understanding of the loss of E/I balance in a range of brain areas at molecular and cellular levels. I further describe how the underlying cellular mechanisms contribute to the disturbance of the proper E/I ratio. Last, I discuss current pharmacologic innervations for RTT and their role in modifying the E/I balance.},

The gains are particularly dramatic for T(2)(*)-weighted imaging, which is sensitive to susceptibility effects caused by a variety of sources, including deoxyhemoglobin, iron concentration, and tissue microstructure. On the other hand, the acquisition of high quality whole brain MRI at high field is hampered by the increased inhomogeneity in B(o) and B(1) fields. In this report, high-resolution gradient echo MRI was performed using an 8-channel detector to obtain T(2)(*)-weighted images over large brain areas. The high SNR achieved with the multi-channel array enabled T(2)(*)-weighted images of the brain with an unprecedented spatial resolution of up to 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.5 mm(3). This high resolution greatly facilitated the detection of microscopic susceptibility effects. In addition to the expected contrast between gray, white matter, cerebral spinal fluid, and veins, a large degree of heterogeneity in contrast was observed throughout the white matter of normal brain. The measured T(2)(*) values in white matter varied as much as 30\% with some of the variation apparently correlating with the presence of large fiber bundles.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical imaging data are typically stored and transferred in the DICOM format, whereas the NIfTI format has been widely adopted by scientists in the neuroimaging community. Therefore, a vital initial step in processing the data is to convert images from the complicated DICOM format to the much simpler NIfTI format. While there are a number of tools that usually handle DICOM to NIfTI conversion seamlessly, some variations can disrupt this process. NEW METHOD: We provide some insight into the challenges faced with image conversion. First, different manufacturers implement the DICOM format differently which complicates the conversion. Second, different modalities and sub-modalities may need special treatment during conversion. Lastly, the image transferring and archiving can also impact the DICOM conversion. RESULTS: We present results in several error-prone domains, including the slice order for functional imaging, phase encoding direction for distortion correction, effect of diffusion gradient direction, and effect of gantry correction for some imaging modality. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Conversion tools are often designed for a specific manufacturer or modality. The tools and insight we present here are aimed at different manufacturers or modalities. CONCLUSIONS: The imaging conversion is complicated by the variation of images. An understanding of the conversion basics can be helpful for identifying the source of the error. Here we provide users with simple methods for detecting and correcting problems. This also serves as an overview for developers who wish to either develop their own tools or adapt the open source tools created by the authors.},

  abstract = {Background  The underlying brain structural changes in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients have attracted increasing attention. The insulin-resistant state causes iron overload in neurons and leads to lesions in the central nervous system. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) can provide a noninvasive quantitative analysis of brain iron deposition. We aimed to compare the difference of brain iron deposition in the gray matter nucleus between T2DM patients and healthy elderly individuals using QSM.  Methods  Thirty-two T2DM patients and thirty-two age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this research. Twenty-three patients and twenty-six HCs underwent cognitive assessments. Brain QSM maps were computed from multiecho GRE data using morphology-enabled dipole inversion with automatic uniform cerebrospinal fluid zero reference algorithm (MEDI+0). ITK-SNAP was used to measure the susceptibility values reflecting the content of iron in the regions of interest (ROIs).  Results  The study included thirty-two T2DM patients (20 males and 12 females; mean age of 61.09 \textpm{} 9.99 years) and 32 HCs (14 males and 18 females; mean age of 59.09 \textpm{} 9.77 years). These participants had no significant difference in age or gender (P {$>$} 0.05). Twenty-three patients with T2DM (11 males and 12 females; mean age, 64.65 \textpm{} 8.44 years) and twenty-six HCs (14 males and 12 females; mean age, 62.30 \textpm{} 6.13 years) received an assessment of cognitive function. T2DM patients exhibited an obviously (t = 3.237, P = 0.003) lower Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score (26.78 \textpm{} 2.35; HCs, 28.42 \textpm{} 0.64; normal standard {$\geq$}26) and a higher Stroop color-word test (SCWT)-C score [87(65,110); HC, 63(60,76.75), Z = -2.232, P = 0.003] than HCs. The mean susceptibility values in the putamen appeared obviously higher in T2DM patients than in HCs (t = -3.994, P {$<$} 0.001). The susceptibility values and cognitive assessment scores showed no obvious association (P {$>$} 0.05). However, an obvious correlation was observed between the changes in the susceptibility values in the putamen and the thalamus/dentate nucleus (r = 0.404, P {$<$} 0.001; r = 0.423, P {$<$} 0.001).  Conclusion  T2DM patients showed increased susceptibility values in the putamen and had declines in executive functions, but the linear association between them was not statistically significant. Changes in susceptibility values in the putamen indicated increased iron deposition and might be used as a quantitative imaging marker of central nervous system injury in T2DM patients. QSM might be able to help probe micro neuronal damage in gray matter and provide information on diabetic encephalopathy.},

  abstract = {The detection of causal interactions is of great importance when inferring complex ecosystem functional and structural networks for basic and applied research. Convergent cross mapping (CCM) based on nonlinear state-space reconstruction made substantial progress about network inference by measuring how well historical values of one variable can reliably estimate states of other variables. Here we investigate the ability of a developed optimal information flow (OIF) ecosystem model to infer bidirectional causality and compare that to CCM. Results from synthetic datasets generated by a simple predator-prey model, data of a real-world sardine-anchovy-temperature system and of a multispecies fish ecosystem highlight that the proposed OIF performs better than CCM to predict population and community patterns. Specifically, OIF provides a larger gradient of inferred interactions, higher point-value accuracy and smaller fluctuations of interactions and \$\$\textbackslash alpha\$\$-diversity including their characteristic time delays. We propose an optimal threshold on inferred interactions that maximize accuracy in predicting fluctuations of effective \$\$\textbackslash alpha\$\$-diversity, defined as the count of model-inferred interacting species. Overall OIF outperforms all other models in assessing predictive causality (also in terms of computational complexity) due to the explicit consideration of synchronization, divergence and diversity of events that define model sensitivity, uncertainty and complexity. Thus, OIF offers a broad ecological information by extracting predictive causal networks of complex ecosystems from time-series data in the space-time continuum. The accurate inference of species interactions at any biological scale of organization is highly valuable because it allows to predict biodiversity changes, for instance as a function of climate and other anthropogenic stressors. This has practical implications for defining optimal ecosystem management and design, such as fish stock prioritization and delineation of marine protected areas based on derived collective multispecies assembly. OIF can be applied to any complex system and used for model evaluation and design where causality should be considered as non-linear predictability of diverse events of populations or communities.},

  abstract = {Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a recently developed MRI technique that provides a quantitative measure of tissue magnetic susceptibility. To compute tissue magnetic susceptibilities based on gradient echoes, QSM requires reliable unwrapping of the measured phase images and removal of contributions caused by background susceptibilities. Typically, the two steps are performed separately. Here, we present a method that simultaneously performs phase unwrapping and HARmonic (background) PhasE REmovaL using the LAplacian operator (HARPERELLA). Both numerical simulations and               in vivo               human brain images show that HARPERELLA effectively removes both phase wraps and background phase, whilst preserving all low spatial frequency components originating from brain tissues. When compared with other QSM phase preprocessing techniques, such as path-based phase unwrapping followed by background phase removal, HARPERELLA preserves the tissue phase signal in gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid with excellent robustness, providing a convenient and accurate solution for QSM. The proposed algorithm is provided, together with QSM and susceptibility tensor imaging (STI) tools, in a shared software package named `STI Suite'.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Recent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have revealed heterogeneous magnetic susceptibility contrasts in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions. Due to its sensitivity to disease-related iron and myelin changes, magnetic susceptibility-based measures may better reflect some pathological features of MS lesions. Hence, we sought to characterize MS lesions using combined R2* mapping and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all, 306 MS lesions were selected from 24 MS patients who underwent 7T MRI. Maps of R2*, frequency, and quantitative susceptibility were calculated using acquired multiecho gradient echo (GRE) phase data. Lesions were categorized based on their image intensity or their anatomical locations. R2* and susceptibility values were quantified in each lesion based on manually drawn lesion masks and compared between lesion groups showing different contrast patterns. Correlations between R2* and susceptibility were also tested in these lesion groups. RESULTS: In 38\% of selected lesions the frequency map did not show the same contrast pattern as the susceptibility map. While most lesions (93\%) showed hypointensity on R2*, the susceptibility contrast in lesions varied, with 40\% being isointense and 58\% being hyperintense in the lesion core. Significant correlations (r\,=\,0.31, P {$<$} 0.001) between R2* and susceptibility were found in susceptibility hyperintense lesions, but not in susceptibility isointense lesions. In addition, a higher proportion (74\%) of periventricular lesions was found to be susceptibility hyperintense as compared to subcortical (53\%) or juxtacortical (38\%) lesions. CONCLUSION: Combining R2* and QSM is useful to characterize heterogeneity in MS lesions.},

In this article, we illustrate the shortcomings of this approach, as we show how later preprocessing steps can reintroduce artifacts previously removed from the data in prior preprocessing steps. We show that each regression step is a geometric projection of data onto a subspace, and that performing a sequence of projections can move the data into subspaces no longer orthogonal to those previously removed, reintroducing signal related to nuisance covariates. Thus, linear filtering operations are not commutative, and the order in which the preprocessing steps are performed is critical. These issues can arise in practice when any combination of standard preprocessing steps including motion regression, scrubbing, component-based correction, physiological correction, global signal regression, and temporal filtering are performed sequentially. In this work, we focus primarily on rs-fMRI. We illustrate the problem both theoretically and empirically through application to a test-retest rs-fMRI data set, and suggest remedies. These include (a) combining all steps into a single linear filter, or (b) sequential orthogonalization of covariates/linear filters performed in series.},

  abstract = {Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data is used to study the intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) in the human brain. In the past decade, interest has focused on studying the temporal dynamics of FC on short timescales, ranging from seconds to minutes. These studies of time-varying FC (TVFC) have enabled the classification of whole-brain dynamic FC profiles into distinct "brain states", defined as recurring whole-brain connectivity profiles reliably observed across subjects and sessions. The analysis of rs-fMRI data is complicated by the fact that the measured BOLD signal consists of changes induced by neuronal activation, as well as non-neuronal nuisance fluctuations that should be removed prior to further analysis. Thus, the data undergoes significant preprocesing prior to analysis. In previous work [24], we illustrated the potential pitfalls involved with using modular preprocessing pipelines, showing how later preprocessing steps can reintroduce correlation with signal previously removed from the data. Here we show that the problem runs deeper, and that certain statistical analysis techniques can potentially interact with preprocessing and reintroduce correlations with previously removed signal. One such technique is the popular sliding window analysis, used to compute TVFC. In this paper, we discuss the problem both theoretically and empirically in application to test-retest rs-fMRI data. Importantly, we show that we are able to obtain essentially the same brain states and state transitions when analyzing motion induced signal as we do when analyzing the preprocessed but windowed data. Our results cast doubt on whether the estimated brain states obtained using sliding window analysis are neuronal in nature, or simply reflect non-neuronal nuisance signal variation (e.g., motion).},

  abstract = {The human brain spontaneously generates neural oscillations with a large variability in frequency, amplitude, duration, and recurrence. Little, however, is known about the long-term spatiotemporal structure of the complex patterns of ongoing activity. A central unresolved issue is whether fluctuations in oscillatory activity reflect a memory of the dynamics of the system for more than a few seconds.  We investigated the temporal correlations of network oscillations in the normal human brain at time scales ranging from a few seconds to several minutes. Ongoing activity during eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions was recorded with simultaneous magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography. Here we show that amplitude fluctuations of 10 and 20 Hz oscillations are correlated over thousands of oscillation cycles. Our analyses also indicated that these amplitude fluctuations obey power-law scaling behavior. The scaling exponents were highly invariant across subjects. We propose that the large variability, the long-range correlations, and the power-law scaling behavior of spontaneous oscillations find a unifying explanation within the theory of self-organized criticality, which offers a general mechanism for the emergence of correlations and complex dynamics in stochastic multiunit systems. The demonstrated scaling laws pose novel quantitative constraints on computational models of network oscillations. We argue that critical-state dynamics of spontaneous oscillations may lend neural networks capable of quick reorganization during processing demands.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study had institutional review board approval, included written informed consent, and complied with HIPAA. Diffusion-tensor imaging and standardized neuropsychologic assessments were performed in 20 patients with mTBI within 2 weeks of injury and 20 matched control subjects. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) images (imaging parameters: 3.0 T, 25 directions, b = 1000 sec/mm(2)) were compared by using whole-brain voxelwise analysis. Spearman correlation analyses were performed to evaluate associations between diffusion measures and executive function. RESULTS: Multiple clusters of lower frontal white matter FA, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), were present in patients (P {$<$} .005), with several clusters also demonstrating higher MD (P {$<$} .005). Patients performed worse on tests of executive function. Lower DLPFC FA was significantly correlated with worse executive function performance in patients (P {$<$} .05). CONCLUSION: Impaired executive function following mTBI is associated with axonal injury involving the DLPFC.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Resting state BOLD fMRI data were acquired at 3T from two independent cohorts of subjects consisting of healthy young (age 23 \textpm{} 2 years, n = 8) and aged volunteers (age 66 \textpm{} 3 years, n = 8), as well as 22 fAD associated subjects (14 mutation carriers, age 41.2 \textpm{} 15.8 years; and eight nonmutation carrying family members, age 28.8 \textpm{} 5.9 years). Mean ApEn values were compared between the two age groups and correlated with cognitive performance in the fAD group. Cross-ApEn (C-ApEn) was further calculated to assess the asynchrony between precuneus and the rest of the brain. RESULTS: Complexity of brain activity measured by mean ApEn in gray and white matter decreased with normal aging. In the fAD group, cognitive impairment was associated with decreased mean ApEn in gray matter as well as decreased regional ApEn in right precuneus, right lateral parietal regions, left precentral gyrus, and right paracentral gyrus. A pattern of asynchrony between BOLD fMRI series emerged from C-ApEn analysis, with significant regional anti-correlation with cross-correlation coefficient of functional connectivity analysis. CONCLUSION: ApEn and C-ApEn may be useful for assessing the complexity and synchronicity of brain activity in normal aging and cognitive decline associated with neurodegenerative diseases.},

We report that the 21.5 and 18.5-kDa myelin basic protein (MBP) isoforms degrade into N-terminal fragments (of 10 and 8 kDa) in the ipsilateral hippocampus and cortex between 2 h and 3 days after controlled cortical impact (in a rat model of TBI), but exhibit no degradation contralaterally. Using N-terminal microsequencing and mass spectrometry, we identified a novel in vivo MBP cleavage site between Phe114 and Lys115. A MBP C-terminal fragment-specific antibody was then raised and shown to specifically detect MBP fragments in affected brain regions following TBI. In vitro naive brain lysate and purified MBP digestion showed that MBP is sensitive to calpain, producing the characteristic MBP fragments observed in TBI. We hypothesize that TBI-mediated axonal injury causes secondary structural damage to the adjacent myelin membrane, instigating MBP degradation. This could initiate myelin sheath instability and demyelination, which might further promote axonal vulnerability.},

Abnormal myelination leads to a wide range of neurological diseases and developmental disorders. Non-invasive imaging of myelin content is of great clinical importance. The present work demonstrated that loss of myelin in the central nervous system of the shiverer mouse results in a dramatic reduction of magnetic susceptibility in white matter axons. The reduction resulted in a near extinction of susceptibility contrast between gray and white matter. Quantitative magnetic susceptibility imaging and diffusion tensor imaging were conducted on a group of control and shiverer mice at 9.4 T. We measured the resonance frequency distribution of the whole brain for each mouse. Magnetic susceptibility maps were computed and compared between the two groups. It was shown that the susceptibility contrast between gray and white matter was reduced by 96\% in the shiverer compared to the controls. Diffusion measurements further confirmed intact fiber pathways in the shiverer mice, ruling out the possibility of axonal injury and its potential contribution to the altered susceptibility. As an autosomal recessive mutation, shiverer is characterized by an almost total lack of central nervous system myelin. Our data provide new evidences indicating that myelin is the predominant source of susceptibility differences between deep gray and white matter observed in magnetic resonance imaging. More importantly, the present study suggests that quantitative magnetic susceptibility is a potential endogenous biomarker for myelination.},

T2-weighted (T2w), T2*-weighted (T2*w), R2* mapping (R2*), phase, susceptibility-weighted (SW), and QSM images were reconstructed for STN depiction. Qualitative visualization scores of STN and internal globus pallidus (GPi) were recorded by two neuroradiologists on all images. Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of the STN and GPi were also measured. Measurement differences were assessed by using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and the signed rank test. RESULTS: Qualitative scores were significantly higher on QSM images than on T2w, T2*w, R2*, phase, or SW images (P {$<$} .05) for STN and GPi visualization. Median CNR was 6.4 and 10.7 times higher on QSM images than on T2w images for differentiation of STN from the zona incerta and substantia nigra, respectively, and was 22.7 and 9.1 times higher on QSM images than on T2w images for differentiation of GPi from the internal capsule and external globus pallidus, respectively. CNR differences between QSM images and all other images were significant (P {$<$} .01). CONCLUSION: QSM at 3-T MR imaging performs significantly better than current standard-of-care sequences in the depiction of the STN.},

  abstract = {The cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) is the rate of oxygen consumption by the brain, and is thought to be a direct index of energy homeostasis and brain health. However, in vivo measurement of CMRO2 is challenging, in particular for the neonatal population, in whom conventional radiotracer methods are not applicable because of safety concerns. In this study, we propose a method to quantify global CMRO2 in neonates based on arteriovenous differences in oxygen content, and employ separate measurements of oxygenation and cerebral blood flow (CBF) parameters. Specifically, arterial and venous oxygenation levels were determined with pulse oximetry and the novel T2 relaxation under spin tagging (TRUST) MRI, respectively. Global CBF was measured with phase contrast (PC) flow velocity MRI. The proposed method was implemented on a standard 3-T MRI scanner without the need for any exogenous tracers, and the total scan duration was less than 5\,min. We demonstrated the feasibility of this method in 12 healthy neonates within an age range of 35-42 gestational weeks. CMRO2 values were successfully obtained from 10 neonates. It was found that the average CMRO2 in this age range was 38.3\,\textpm\,17.7\,\textmu mol/100\,g/min and was positively correlated with age (p\,=\,0.007; slope, 5.2\,\textmu mol/100\,g/min per week), although the highest CMRO2 value in this age range was still less than half of the adult level. Test-retest studies showed a coefficient of variation of 5.8\,\textpm\,2.2\% between repeated CMRO2 measurements. In addition, given the highly variable blood flow velocity within this age range, it is recommended that the TRUST labeling thickness and position should be determined on a subject-by-subject basis, and an automatic algorithm was developed for this purpose. Although this method provides a global CMRO2 measure only, the clinical significance of an energy consumption marker and the convenience of this technique may make it a useful tool in the functional assessment of the neonatal population.},

  abstract = {Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a recently developed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique for quantifying the spatial distribution of magnetic susceptibility within biological tissues. It first uses the frequency shift in the MRI signal to map the magnetic field profile within the tissue. The resulting field map is then used to determine the spatial distribution of the underlying magnetic susceptibility by solving an inverse problem. The solution is achieved by deconvolving the field map with a dipole field, under the assumption that the magnetic field results from a superposition of the dipole fields generated by all voxels and that each voxel has its own unique magnetic susceptibility. QSM provides an improved contrast-to-noise ratio for certain tissues and structures compared with its magnitude counterpart. More importantly, magnetic susceptibility directly reflects the molecular composition and cellular architecture of the tissue. Consequently, by quantifying magnetic susceptibility, QSM is becoming a quantitative imaging approach for characterizing normal and pathological tissue properties. This article reviews the mechanism that generates susceptibility contrast within tissues and some associated applications.},

It is created by combining both magnitude and phase in the gradient echo data. SWI is sensitive to both paramagnetic and diamagnetic substances which generate different phase shift in MRI data. SWI images can be displayed as a minimum intensity projection that provides high resolution delineation of the cerebral venous architecture, a feature that is not available in other MRI techniques. As such, SWI has been widely applied to diagnose various venous abnormalities. SWI is especially sensitive to deoxygenated blood and intracranial mineral deposition and, for that reason, has been applied to image various pathologies including intracranial hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, stroke, neoplasm, and multiple sclerosis. SWI, however, does not provide quantitative measures of magnetic susceptibility. This limitation is currently being addressed with the development of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and susceptibility tensor imaging (STI). While QSM treats susceptibility as isotropic, STI treats susceptibility as generally anisotropic characterized by a tensor quantity.

  abstract = {Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe and progressive neurological disorder, which mainly affects young females. Mutations of the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene are the most prevalent cause of classical RTT cases. MECP2 mutations or altered expression are also associated with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders with recent links to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Collectively, MeCP2 relation to these neurodevelopmental disorders highlights the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms by which MeCP2 impacts brain development, mental conditions, and compromised brain function. Since MECP2 mutations were discovered to be the primary cause of RTT, a significant progress has been made in the MeCP2 research, with respect to the expression, function and regulation of MeCP2 in the brain and its contribution in RTT pathogenesis. To date, there have been intensive efforts in designing effective therapeutic strategies for RTT benefiting from mouse models and cells collected from RTT patients. Despite significant progress in MeCP2 research over the last few decades, there is still a knowledge gap between the in vitro and in vivo research findings and translating these findings into effective therapeutic interventions in human RTT patients. In this review, we will provide a synopsis of Rett syndrome as a severe neurological disorder and will discuss the role of MeCP2 in RTT pathophysiology.},

Neuroprotective treatments that limit secondary tissue loss and/or improve behavioral outcome have been well established in multiple animal models of TBI. However, translation of such neuroprotective strategies to human injury have been disappointing, with the failure of more than thirty controlled clinical trials. Both conceptual issues and methodological differences between preclinical and clinical injury have undoubtedly contributed to these translational difficulties. More recently, changes in experimental approach, as well as altered clinical trial methodologies, have raised cautious optimism regarding the outcomes of future clinical trials. Here we critically review developing experimental neuroprotective strategies that show promise, and we propose criteria for improving the probability of successful clinical translation.},

Ex vivo experiments showed that gray-white matter phase contrast remains unchanged after iron extraction.

  abstract = {The 1/f-like decay observed in the power spectrum of electro-physiological signals, along with scale-free statistics of the so-called neuronal avalanches, constitutes evidence of criticality in neuronal systems. Recent in vitro studies have shown that avalanche dynamics at criticality corresponds to some specific balance of excitation and inhibition, thus suggesting that this is a basic feature of the critical state of neuronal networks. In particular, a lack of inhibition significantly alters the temporal structure of the spontaneous avalanche activity and leads to an anomalous abundance of large avalanches. Here, we study the relationship between network inhibition and the scaling exponent {$\beta$} of the power spectral density (PSD) of avalanche activity in a neuronal network model inspired in Self-Organized Criticality. We find that this scaling exponent depends on the percentage of inhibitory synapses and tends to the value {$\beta$}\,=\,1 for a percentage of about 30\%. More specifically, {$\beta$} is close to 2, namely, Brownian noise, for purely excitatory networks and decreases towards values in the interval [1, 1.4] as the percentage of inhibitory synapses ranges between 20\% and 30\%, in agreement with experimental findings. These results indicate that the level of inhibition affects the frequency spectrum of resting brain activity and suggest the analysis of the PSD scaling behavior as a possible tool to study pathological conditions.},

We explicitly demonstrate this for neurotransmitter secretion at Xenopus neuromuscular junctions and for rat hippocampal synapses in culture; the exocytosis of exogenously supplied neurotransmitter from cultured Xenopus myocytes and from rat fibroblasts behaves similarly. The magnitude of the fluctuations of the rate of exocytic events about the mean decreases slowly as the rate is computed over longer and longer time periods, the periodogram decreases in power-law manner with frequency, and the Allan factor (relative variance of the number of exocytic events) increases as a power-law function of the counting time. These features are hallmarks of self-similar behavior. Their description requires models that exhibit long-range correlation (memory) in event occurrences. We have developed a physiologically plausible model that accords with all of the statistical measures that we have examined. The appearance of fractal behavior at synapses, as well as in systems comprising collections of synapses, indicates that such behavior is ubiquitous in neural signaling.},

  abstract = {Recently, a T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST) MRI technique was developed to quantitatively estimate blood oxygen saturation fraction (Y) via the measurement of pure blood T2. This technique has shown promise for normalization of fMRI signals, for the assessment of oxygen metabolism, and in studies of cognitive aging and multiple sclerosis. However, a human validation study has not been conducted. In addition, the calibration curve used to convert blood T2 to Y has not accounted for the effects of hematocrit (Hct). In this study, we first conducted experiments on blood samples under physiologic conditions, and the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill T2 was determined for a range of Y and Hct values. The data were fitted to a two-compartment exchange model to allow the characterization of a three-dimensional plot that can serve to calibrate the in vivo data. Next, in a validation study in humans, we showed that arterial Y estimated using TRUST MRI was 0.837 \textpm{} 0.036 (N=7) during the inhalation of 14\% O2, which was in excellent agreement with the gold-standard Y values of 0.840 \textpm{} 0.036 based on Pulse-Oximetry. These data suggest that the availability of this calibration plot should enhance the applicability of T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging MRI for noninvasive assessment of cerebral blood oxygenation.

METHODS: 39 patients with mTBI and 37 normal controls were given the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and underwent SWI scanning at least 6 months after injury. Angle radian values were calculated with phase images. The angle radian values were compared between groups using analysis of covariance, and their association with MMSE scores was analyzed using Spearman correlations. RESULTS: Significantly higher angle radian values (p {$<$} 0.05) were found in the head of the caudate nucleus, the lenticular nucleus, the hippocampus, the thalamus, the right substantia nigra, the red nucleus, and the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC) in the mTBI group, compared to the control group. MMSE scores were negatively correlated with angle radian values in the right substantia nigra (r = -0.685, p {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with chronic mTBI might have abnormally high accumulations of iron, and their MMSE scores are negatively associated with angle radian values in the right substantia nigra, suggesting a role of SWI in the assessment of cognitive impairments of these patients.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose Cerebral tissue oxygenation is a critical brain viability parameter, and the magnetic properties of hemoglobin offer the opportunity to noninvasively quantify oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrahigh-field MRI shows advantages such as increased sensitivity to magnetic susceptibility differences and improved signal-to-noise ratio that can be translated into smaller voxel size, but also increased sensitivity to static and B1 field inhomogeneities. The aim was to produce a systematic comparison of three MRI-based methods for estimation of OEF. Methods OEF estimates in 16 healthy subjects were obtained at 7T utilizing susceptometry-based oximetry (SBO), quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and transverse relaxation rate (R2*). Two major draining veins, that is, the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and the straight sinus (SS), were investigated, including mutual agreement between the methods in each of the two different vessels, agreement between vessels as well as potential vessel angle and vessel size dependences. Results Very good correlation (r~=~.88) was found between SBO-based and QSM-based OEF estimates in SSS. Only QSM showed a moderate correlation (r~=~.61) between corresponding OEF estimates in SSS and SS. For SBO, a trend of increasing OEF estimates was observed as the SS vessel angle relative to the main magnetic field increased. No obvious size dependence could be established for any method. The R2*-based OEF estimates were reasonable (35\%-36\%), but the observed range was somewhat low. Conclusion The results indicate that QSM is a promising candidate for assessment of OEF estimates, for example, providing reasonably robust estimates across a wide range of vessel orientations.},

Two distinct mechanisms were found to underlie a water (1)H resonance frequency shift: (i) a protein-concentration-induced change in bulk magnetic susceptibility, causing a shift to lower frequency, and (ii) exchange of water between chemical-shift distinct environments, i.e., free (bulk water) and protein-associated ("bound") water, including freely exchangeable (1)H sites on proteins, causing a shift to higher frequency. At 37 degrees C the amplitude of the exchange effect is roughly half that of the susceptibility effect.},

  abstract = {Noninvasive measurement of cerebral venous oxygenation can serve as a tool for better understanding fMRI signals and for clinical evaluation of brain oxygen homeostasis. In this study a novel technique, T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST) MRI, is developed to estimate oxygenation in venous vessels. This method uses the spin labeling principle to automatically isolate pure blood signals from which T2 relaxation times are determined using flow-insensitive T2-preparation pulses. The blood T2 is then converted to blood oxygenation using a calibration plot. In vivo experiments gave a baseline venous oxygenation of 64.8 \textpm{} 6.3\% in sagittal sinus in healthy volunteers (n = 24). Reproducibility studies demonstrated that the standard deviation across trials was 2.0 \textpm{} 1.1\%. The effects of repetition time and inversion time selections were investigated. The TRUST technique was further tested using various physiologic challenges. Hypercapnia induced an increase in venous oxygenation by 13.8 \textpm{} 1.1\%. On the other hand, caffeine ingestion resulted in a decrease in oxygenation by 7.0 \textpm{} 1.8\%. Contrast agent infusion (Gd-DTPA, 0.1 mmol/kg) reduced venous blood T2 by 11.2 ms. The results of this study show that TRUST MRI is a useful technique for quantitative assessment of blood oxygenation in the brain.

  abstract = {A key challenge for neural modeling is to explain how a continuous stream of multimodal input from a rapidly changing environment can be processed by stereotypical recurrent circuits of integrate-and-fire neurons in real time. We propose a new computational model for real-time computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems in robotics and neurotechnology.},

Here, we continuously monitored the statistics of network spiking in visual cortical circuits in freely behaving rats for 9days. Under control conditions in light and dark, networks were robustly organized around criticality, a regime that maximizes information capacity and transmission. When input was perturbed by visual deprivation, network criticality was severely disrupted and subsequently restored to criticality over 48 h. Unexpectedly, the recovery of excitatory dynamics preceded homeostatic plasticity of firing rates by {$>$}30 h. We utilized model investigations to manipulate firing rate homeostasis in a cell-type-specific manner at the onset of visual deprivation. Our results suggest that criticality in excitatory networks is established by inhibitory plasticity and architecture. These data establish that criticality is consistent with a homeostatic set point for visual cortical dynamics and suggest a key role for homeostatic regulation of inhibition.},

  abstract = {Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has become an indispensable tool in neuroscience research. Despite this, rs-fMRI signals are easily contaminated by artifacts arising from movement of the head during data collection. The artifacts can be problematic even for motions on the millimeter scale, with complex spatiotemporal properties that can lead to substantial errors in functional connectivity estimates. Effective correction methods must be employed, therefore, to distinguish true functional networks from motion-related noise. Research over the last three decades has produced numerous correction methods, many of which must be applied in combination to achieve satisfactory data quality. Subject instruction, training, and mild restraints are helpful at the outset, but usually insufficient. Improvements come from applying multiple motion correction algorithms retrospectively after rs-fMRI data are collected, although residual artifacts can still remain in cases of elevated motion, which are especially prevalent in patient populations. Although not commonly adopted at present, "real-time" correction methods are emerging that can be combined with retrospective methods and that promise better correction and increased rs-fMRI signal sensitivity. While the search for the ideal motion correction protocol continues, rs-fMRI research will benefit from good disclosure practices, such as: (1) reporting motion-related quality control metrics to provide better comparison between studies; and (2) including motion covariates in group-level analyses to limit the extent of motion-related confounds when studying group differences.},

Understanding this connectome in detail may provide insights into normal as well as abnormal patterns of brain development. Following established best practices adopted by the WU-MINN Human Connectome Project (HCP), and pioneered by FreeSurfer, the project utilises cortical surface-based processing pipelines. In this paper, we propose a fully automated processing pipeline for the structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the developing neonatal brain. This proposed pipeline consists of a refined framework for cortical and sub-cortical volume segmentation, cortical surface extraction, and cortical surface inflation, which has been specifically designed to address considerable differences between adult and neonatal brains, as imaged using MRI. Using the proposed pipeline our results demonstrate that images collected from 465 subjects ranging from 28 to 45 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA) can be processed fully automatically; generating cortical surface models that are topologically correct, and correspond well with manual evaluations of tissue boundaries in 85\% of cases. Results improve on state-of-the-art neonatal tissue segmentation models and significant errors were found in only 2\% of cases, where these corresponded to subjects with high motion. Downstream, these surfaces will enhance comparisons of functional and diffusion MRI datasets, supporting the modelling of emerging patterns of brain connectivity.},

Method In a prospective cohort of 193 neonates born preterm, 24 to 32 weeks' gestation, we used magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging acquired early in life (n=193) and at term-equivalent age (n=159) to measure corpus callosum development: mid-sagittal area (including corpus callosum subdivisions) and length, and fractional anisotropy from the genu and splenium. We examined the association of (1) intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and white matter injury (WMI) severity, and (2) neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months corrected age with corpus callosum development. Results Severe WMI and severe IVH were strongly associated with reduced corpus callosum area (both p{$<$}0.001) and WMI with lower fractional anisotropy (p=0.002). Mild WMI predicted smaller corpus callosum area only posteriorly; mild IVH predicted smaller area throughout. Adverse motor outcome was associated with smaller corpus callosum size in the posterior subdivision (p=0.003). Abnormal cognitive outcomes were associated with lower corpus callosum fractional anisotropy (p=0.008). Interpretation In newborn infants born very preterm, brain injury is associated with changes in simple metrics of corpus callosum development. In this population, the development of the corpus callosum, as reflected by size and microstructure, is associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months corrected age.},

  abstract = {The cause of Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) is unknown, but neuroimaging evidence suggests that DCD may be related to altered brain development. Children with DCD show less structural and functional connectivity compared to typically developing (TD) children, but few studies have examined cortical volume in children with DCD. The purpose of this study was to investigate cortical grey matter volume using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in children with DCD compared to TD children. Methods: This cross-sectional study was part of a larger randomized-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02597751) that involved various MRI scans of children with/without DCD. This paper focuses on the anatomical scans, performing VBM of cortical grey matter volume in 30 children with DCD and 12 TD children. Preprocessing and VBM data analysis were conducted using the Computational Anatomy Tool Box-12 and a study-specific brain template. Differences between DCD and TD groups were assessed using a one-way ANOVA, controlling for total intracranial volume. Regression analyses examined if motor and/or attentional difficulties predicted grey matter volume. We used threshold-free cluster enhancement (5000 permutations) and set an alpha level of 0.05. Due to the small sample size, we did not correct for multiple comparisons. Results: Compared to the TD group, children with DCD had significantly greater grey matter in the left superior frontal gyrus. Lower motor scores (meaning greater impairment) were related to greater grey matter volume in left superior frontal gyrus, frontal pole, and right middle frontal gyrus. Greater grey matter volume was also significantly correlated with higher scores on the Conners 3 ADHD Index in the left superior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobe, and precuneus. These results indicate that greater grey matter volume in these regions is associated with poorer motor and attentional skills. Discussion: Greater grey matter volume in the left superior frontal gyrus in children with DCD may be a result of delayed or absent healthy cortical thinning, potentially due to altered synaptic pruning as seen in other neurodevelopmental disorders. These findings provide further support for the hypothesis that DCD is related to altered brain development.},

We recently showed structural and functional brain changes after CO-OP, including increased cerebellar grey matter. This study aimed to determine whether CO-OP intervention induced changes in cortical grey matter volume in children with DCD, and if these changes were associated with improvements in motor performance and movement quality. Methods: This study is part of a randomized waitlist-control trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02597751). Children with DCD (N=78) were randomized to either a treatment or waitlist group and underwent three MRIs over six months. The treatment group received intervention (once weekly for 10 weeks) between the first and second scan; the waitlist group received intervention between the second and third scan. Cortical grey matter volume was measured using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Behavioral outcome measures included the Performance Quality Rating Scale (PQRS) and Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-2 (BOT-2). Of the 78 children, 58 were excluded (mostly due to insufficient data quality), leaving a final N=20 for analyses. Due to the small sample size, we combined both groups to examine treatment effects. Cortical grey matter volume differences were assessed using a repeated measures ANOVA, controlling for total intracranial volume. Regression analyses examined the relationship of grey matter volume changes to BOT-2 (motor performance) and PQRS (movement quality). Results: After CO-OP, children had significantly decreased grey matter in the right superior frontal gyrus and middle/posterior cingulate gyri. We found no significant associations of grey matter volume changes with PQRS or BOT-2 scores. Conclusion: Decreased cortical grey matter volume generally reflects greater brain maturity. Decreases in grey matter volume after CO-OP intervention were in regions associated with self-regulation and motor control, consistent with our other studies. Decreased grey matter volume may be due to focal increases in synaptic pruning, perhaps as a result of strengthening networks in the brain via the repeated learning and actions in therapy. Findings from this study add to the growing body of literature demonstrating positive neuroplastic changes in the brain after CO-OP intervention.},

During the experiment, STN stimulation again induced a hypomanic state concomitant with activation of cortical and thalamic regions known to process limbic and associative information. This observation suggests that the STN plays a role in the control of a complex behavior that includes emotional as well as cognitive and motor components. The localization of the four contacts of the quadripolar electrode was determined precisely with an interactive brain atlas. The results showed that (i) the hypomanic state was caused only by stimulation through one contact localized in the anteromedial STN; (ii) both this contact and the contact immediately dorsal to it improved the parkinsonian motor state; (iii) the most dorsal and ventral contacts, located at the boundaries of the STN, neither induced the behavioral disorder nor improved motor performance. Detailed analysis of these data led us to consider a model in which the three functional modalities, emotional, cognitive, and motor, are not processed in a segregated manner but can be subtly combined in the small volume of the STN. This nucleus would thus serve as a nexus that integrates the motor, cognitive, and emotional components of behavior and might consequently be an effective target for the treatment of behavioral disorders that combine emotional, cognitive, and motor impairment.},

Near-infrared spectroscopy can augment current physiologic monitoring to increase awareness of abnormal perfusion status in the preterm population and potentially reduce risks associated with many diseases that may lead to ischemic injury. This article provides an overview describing NIRS technology and function, its current use in neonatology, and pertinent research findings illustrating its benefit in the neonatal population.

METHODS: We studied at the time of early school age children who had been born at 25 or fewer completed weeks of gestation in the United Kingdom and Ireland in 1995. Each child had been evaluated at 30 months of age. The children underwent standardized cognitive and neurologic assessments at six years of age. Disability was defined as severe (indicating dependence on caregivers), moderate, or mild according to predetermined criteria. RESULTS: Of 308 surviving children, 241 (78 percent) were assessed at a median age of six years and four months; 160 classmates delivered at full term served as a comparison group. Although the use of test reference norms showed that cognitive impairment (defined as results more than 2 SD below the mean) was present in 21 percent of the children born extremely preterm (as compared with 1 percent in the standardized data), this value rose to 41 percent when the results were compared with those for their classmates. The rates of severe, moderate, and mild disability were 22 percent, 24 percent, and 34 percent, respectively; disabling cerebral palsy was present in 30 children (12 percent). Among children with severe disability at 30 months of age, 86 percent still had moderate-to-severe disability at 6 years of age. In contrast, other disabilities at the age of 30 months were poorly predictive of developmental problems at 6 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Among extremely preterm children, cognitive and neurologic impairment is common at school age. A comparison with their classroom peers indicates a level of impairment that is greater than is recognized with the use of standardized norms.},

  abstract = {Recent studies at high magnetic fields using the phase of gradient-echo MR images have shown the ability to unveil cortical substructure in the human brain. To investigate the contrast mechanisms in phase imaging, this study extends, for the first time, phase imaging to the rodent brain. Using a 14.1 T horizontal bore animal MRI scanner for in vivo micro-imaging, images with an in-plane resolution of 33 microm were acquired. Phase images revealed, often more clearly than the corresponding magnitude images, hippocampal fields, cortical layers (e.g. layer 4), cerebellar layers (molecular and granule cell layers) and small white matter structures present in the striatum and septal nucleus. The contrast of the phase images depended in part on the orientation of anatomical structures relative to the magnetic field, consistent with bulk susceptibility variations between tissues. This was found not only for vessels, but also for white matter structures, such as the anterior commissure, and cortical layers in the cerebellum. Such susceptibility changes could result from variable blood volume. However, when the deoxyhemoglobin content was reduced by increasing cerebral blood flow (CBF) with a carbogen breathing challenge, contrast between white and gray matter and cortical layers was not affected, suggesting that tissue cerebral blood volume (and therefore deoxyhemoglobin) is not a major source of the tissue phase contrast. We conclude that phase variations in gradient-echo images are likely due to susceptibility shifts of non-vascular origin.},

For this purpose, a four-stage grading system was developed by correlating magnetic resonance images from age-matched postmortem brains with subsequently prepared myelin-stained macroslices. Gyration and myelination progressed in a occipito-rostral direction. Stages 3 and 4 myelination were recognized earlier on T1-weighted images [spin echo (SE) 500/30] than on T2-weighted images (SE 3,000/120). However, long repetition time/echo time sequences yielded better contrast and allowed finer differentiation between myelinated and nonmyelinated structures. At term, the posterior limb of the internal capsule was generally myelinated (stage 2), whereas in 50\% of the children, myelin appeared in the TC between 55 and 65 weeks' PCA, e.g., between 3 and 6 months postnatally. The morphological differentiation of the brain surface preceded the biochemical maturation (myelination) by an average of 12 months. Applying such a grading system to a larger population will help establish normal standards for brain maturation and a "brain age" scale during the first 4 years of life.},

  abstract = {Preterm birth is a major public-health issue because of its increasing incidence combined with the frequent occurrence of subsequent behavioral, neurological, and psychiatric challenges faced by surviving infants. Approximately 10-15\% of very preterm children (born{$<$}30 weeks gestational age) develop cerebral palsy, and 30-60\% of them experience cognitive impairments. These adverse outcomes are related to a confluence of abnormal brain development along with white (WM) and gray matter (GM) injury sustained during the neonatal period. It is becoming apparent that the extra-uterine environment during this critical period (24-40 weeks gestation) in brain development has a profound and long lasting impact on the premature infant. Magnetic resonance imaging in the neonatal period and infancy provides a non-invasive, "in vivo" assessment of brain development and extent of brain injury. This not only helps understand the extent and timing of injury but also identifies infants who may benefit from early intervention to minimize the impact of the injury. LEARNING OUTCOMES: Readers will be able to (1) appreciate the diverse impact of prematurity on neurodevelopmental outcome, (2) recognize the biological vulnerability of the developing brain in premature infants born between 24 and 40 weeks of gestation, (3) understand the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a tool to detect abnormal development and brain injury in premature infants, and (4) see the potential role for novel MR imaging methods as biomarkers for brain development and injury in premature infants.},

  abstract = {Fractional Gaussian noise (fGn) provides a parsimonious model for stationary increments of a self-similar process parameterised by the Hurst exponent, H, and variance, sigma2. Fractional Gaussian noise with H {$<$} 0.5 demonstrates negatively autocorrelated or antipersistent behaviour; fGn with H {$>$} 0.5 demonstrates 1/f, long memory or persistent behaviour; and the special case of fGn with H = 0.5 corresponds to classical Gaussian white noise. We comparatively evaluate four possible estimators of fGn parameters, one method implemented in the time domain and three in the wavelet domain. We show that a wavelet-based maximum likelihood (ML) estimator yields the most efficient estimates of H and sigma2 in simulated fGn with 0 {$<$} H {$<$} 1. Applying this estimator to fMRI data acquired in the "resting" state from healthy young and older volunteers, we show empirically that fGn provides an accommodating model for diverse species of fMRI noise, assuming adequate preprocessing to correct effects of head movement, and that voxels with H {$>$} 0.5 tend to be concentrated in cortex whereas voxels with H {$<$} 0.5 are more frequently located in ventricles and sulcal CSF. The wavelet-ML estimator can be generalised to estimate the parameter vector beta for general linear modelling (GLM) of a physiological response to experimental stimulation and we demonstrate nominal type I error control in multiple testing of beta, divided by its standard error, in simulated and biological data under the null hypothesis beta = 0. We illustrate these methods principally by showing that there are significant differences between patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-matched comparison subjects in the persistence of fGn in the medial and lateral temporal lobes, insula, dorsal cingulate/medial premotor cortex, and left pre- and postcentral gyrus: patients with AD had greater persistence of resting fMRI noise (larger H) in these regions. Comparable abnormalities in the AD patients were also identified by a permutation test of local differences in the first-order autoregression AR(1) coefficient, which was significantly more positive in patients. However, we found that the Hurst exponent provided a more sensitive metric than the AR(1) coefficient to detect these differences, perhaps because neurophysiological changes in early AD are naturally better described in terms of abnormal salience of long memory dynamics than a change in the strength of association between immediately consecutive time points. We conclude that parsimonious mapping of fMRI noise properties in terms of fGn parameters efficiently estimated in the wavelet domain is feasible and can enhance insight into the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.},

The majority of experimental studies using animals have, however, discussed only the ultrastructural pathophysiology of injured central white matter leading to secondary axotomy and the formation of axonal terminal bulbs. Using the stretch-injured optic nerve model in adult guinea pigs, the present study provides novel quantitative data concerning Wallerian degeneration of disconnected axonal fragments following secondary axotomy out to 12 weeks after injury to an optic nerve. The time course of Wallerian degeneration at the level of an individual nerve fiber is comparable to that reported in earlier studies over 48\,h to two weeks after secondary axotomy. But only a relatively small proportion of nerve fibers within the optic tract degenerate via Wallerian degeneration during the first two weeks. Rather, examples of each of the three stages of Wallerian degeneration-acute axonal degeneration, latency of the distal axonal segment, and granular fragmentation-occur within the optic tract across the entire experimental survival of 12 weeks used in the present study. This data suggests that some nerve fibers initiate Wallerian degeneration days and weeks after the initial time of mechanical injury to an optic nerve. The number of intact nerve fibers continues to fall over at least three months after injury in the stretch-injury model of traumatic axonal injury. It is suggested that these novel findings relate to the mechanism(s) whereby central white matter volume decreases over months and years in CTE patients.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Only a handful of studies have investigated the nature, functional significance, and course of white matter abnormalities associated with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) during the semi-acute stage of injury. The present study used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate white matter integrity and compared the accuracy of traditional anatomic scans, neuropsychological testing, and DTI for objectively classifying mTBI patients from controls. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with semi-acute mTBI (mean = 12 days postinjury), 21 matched healthy controls, and a larger sample (n = 32) of healthy controls were studied with an extensive imaging and clinical battery. A subset of participants was examined longitudinally 3-5 months after their initial visit. RESULTS: mTBI patients did not differ from controls on clinical imaging scans or neuropsychological performance, although effect sizes were consistent with literature values. In contrast, mTBI patients demonstrated significantly greater fractional anisotropy as a result of reduced radial diffusivity in the corpus callosum and several left hemisphere tracts. DTI measures were more accurate than traditional clinical measures in classifying patients from controls. Longitudinal data provided preliminary evidence of partial normalization of DTI values in several white matter tracts. CONCLUSIONS: Current findings of white matter abnormalities suggest that cytotoxic edema may be present during the semi-acute phase of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Initial mechanical damage to axons disrupts ionic homeostasis and the ratio of intracellular and extracellular water, primarily affecting diffusion perpendicular to axons. Diffusion tensor imaging measurement may have utility for objectively classifying mTBI, and may serve as a potential biomarker of recovery.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a clinical presentation characterized by memory impairment and executive dysfunction. Our group previously demonstrated significant alterations in white matter microstructural metrics in AD compared to healthy older adults. We aimed to further investigate the relationship between white matter microstructure in AD and cognitive function, including memory and executive function. Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neuropsychological data were downloaded from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative database for 49 individuals with AD and 48 matched healthy older adults. The relationship between whole-brain fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AxD), radial diffusivity (RD), and composite scores of memory and executive function was examined. We also considered voxel-wise relationships using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics. Results: As expected, individuals with AD had lower composite scores on tests of memory and executive function, as well as disrupted white matter integrity (low FA, high MD, AxD, and RD) relative to healthy older adults in widespread regions, including the hippocampus. When the AD and healthy older adult groups were combined, we found significant relationships between DTI metrics (FA/MD/AxD/RD) and memory scores across widespread regions of the brain, including the medial temporal regions. We also found significant relationships between DTI metrics (FA/MD/AxD/RD) and executive function in widespread regions, including the frontal areas in the combined group. However, when the groups were examined separately, no significant relationships were found between DTI metrics (FA/MD/AxD/RD) and memory performance for either group. Further, we did not find any significant relationships between DTI metrics (FA/MD/AxD/RD) and executive function in the AD group, but we did observe significant relationships between FA/RD, and executive function in healthy older adults. Conclusion: White matter integrity is disrupted in AD. In a mixed sample of AD and healthy elderly persons, associations between measures of white matter microstructure and memory and executive cognitive test performance were evident. However, no significant linear relationship between the degree of white matter disruption and level of cognitive functioning (memory and executive abilities) was found in those with AD. Future longitudinal studies of the relations between DTI metrics and cognitive function in AD are required to determine whether DTI has potential to measure progression of AD and/or treatment efficacy.},

BACKGROUND: Many individuals complain of memory difficulty shortly after MTBI. Memory performance in these individuals can be normal despite these complaints. METHODS: Brain activation patterns in response to a working memory task (auditory n-back) were assessed with functional MRI in 12 MTBI patients within 1 month of their injury and in 11 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: Brain activation patterns differed between MTBI patients and control subjects in response to increasing working memory processing loads. Maximum intensity projections of statistical parametric maps in control subjects showed bifrontal and biparietal activation in response to a low processing load, with little additional increase in activation associated with the high load task. MTBI patients showed some activation during the low processing load task but significantly increased activation during the high load condition, particularly in the right parietal and right dorsolateral frontal regions. Task performance did not differ significantly between groups. CONCLUSION: MTBI patients differed from control subjects in activation pattern of working memory circuitry in response to different processing loads, despite similar task performance. This suggests that injury-related changes in ability to activate or to modulate working memory processing resources may underlie some of the memory complaints after MTBI.},

Iron plays an important role in many neurodevelopmental processes, and animal studies suggest that iron sufficiency in pregnancy and infancy is particularly important for neurodevelopment. However, it is not clear whether iron deficiency directly impacts developmental outcomes, and, if so, whether impact differs by timing of exposure or developmental domain. We searched four databases for studies on iron deficiency or iron supplementation in pregnancy, or at 0--6 months, 6--24 months, or 2--4 years of age. All studies included neurodevelopmental assessments in infants or children up to 4 years old. We then qualitatively synthesized the literature. There was no clear relationship between iron status and developmental outcomes across any of the time windows or domains included. We identified a large quantity of low-quality studies, significant heterogeneity in study design and a lack of research focused on pregnancy and early infancy. In summary, despite good mechanistic evidence for the role of iron in brain development, evidence for the impact of iron deficiency or iron supplementation on early development is inconsistent. Further high-quality research is needed, particularly within pregnancy and early infancy, which has previously been neglected.},

  abstract = {Objective               Recently, we reported that the neocortex displays impaired growth after transient cerebral hypoxia--ischemia (HI) at preterm gestation that is unrelated to neuronal death but is associated with decreased dendritic arbor complexity of cortical projection neurons. We hypothesized that these morphological changes constituted part of a more widespread neuronal dysmaturation response to HI in the caudate nucleus (CN), which contributes to motor and cognitive disability in preterm survivors.                                         Methods               Ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), immunohistochemistry, and Golgi staining defined CN growth, cell death, proliferation, and dendritic maturation in preterm fetal sheep 4 weeks after HI. Patch-clamp recording was used to analyze glutamatergic synaptic currents in CN neurons.                                         Results               MRI-defined growth of the CN was reduced after ischemia compared to controls. However, no significant acute or delayed neuronal death was seen in the CN or white matter. Nor was there significant loss of calbindin-positive medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs) or CN interneurons expressing somatostatin, calretinin, parvalbumin, or tyrosine hydroxylase. Morphologically, ischemic MSNs showed a markedly immature dendritic arbor, with fewer dendritic branches, nodes, endings, and spines. The magnitude and kinetics of synaptic currents, and the relative contribution of glutamate receptor subtypes in the CN were significantly altered.                                         Interpretation               The marked MSN dendritic and functional abnormalities after preterm cerebral HI, despite the marked resistance of immature CN neurons to cell death, are consistent with widespread susceptibility of projection neurons to HI-induced dysmaturation. These global disturbances in dendritic maturation and glutamatergic synaptic transmission suggest a new mechanism for long-term motor and behavioral disabilities in preterm survivors via widespread disruption of neuronal connectivity.

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Lack of empirical data on recovery time following sport-related concussion hampers clinical decision making about return to play after injury. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively measure immediate effects and natural recovery course relating to symptoms, cognitive functioning, and postural stability following sport-related concussion. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study of 1631 football players from 15 US colleges. All players underwent preseason baseline testing on concussion assessment measures in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Ninety-four players with concussion (based on American Academy of Neurology criteria) and 56 noninjured controls underwent assessment of symptoms, cognitive functioning, and postural stability immediately, 3 hours, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 90 days after injury. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Scores on the Graded Symptom Checklist (GSC), Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC), Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), and a neuropsychological test battery. RESULTS: No player with concussion was excluded from participation; 79 players with concussion (84\%) completed the protocol through day 90. Players with concussion exhibited more severe symptoms (mean GSC score 20.93 [95\% confidence interval [CI], 15.65-26.21] points higher than that of controls), cognitive impairment (mean SAC score 2.94 [95\% CI, 1.50-4.38] points lower than that of controls), and balance problems (mean BESS score 5.81 [95\% CI, -0.67 to 12.30] points higher than that of controls) immediately after concussion. On average, symptoms gradually resolved by day 7 (GSC mean difference, 0.33; 95\% CI, -1.41 to 2.06), cognitive functioning improved to baseline levels within 5 to 7 days (day 7 SAC mean difference, -0.03; 95\% CI, -1.33 to 1.26), and balance deficits dissipated within 3 to 5 days after injury (day 5 BESS mean difference, -0.31; 95\% CI, -3.02 to 2.40). Mild impairments in cognitive processing and verbal memory evident on neuropsychological testing 2 days after concussion resolved by day 7. There were no significant differences in symptoms or functional impairments in the concussion and control groups 90 days after concussion. CONCLUSIONS: Collegiate football players may require several days for recovery of symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, and postural instability after concussion. Further research is required to determine factors that predict variability in recovery time after concussion. Standardized measurement of postconcussive symptoms, cognitive functioning, and postural stability may enhance clinical management of athletes recovering from concussion.},

Local injection of lysolecithin into the brain or spinal cord provides a murine model of demyelination with spontaneous remyelination. The aim of this study was to determine if quantitative, multicomponent T(2) (qT(2)) analysis and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), both indicative of myelin content, could detect changes in myelination, particularly remyelination, of the cervical spinal cord in mice treated with lysolecithin. We found that the myelin water fraction and geometric mean T(2) value of the intra/extracellular water significantly decreased at 14 days then returned to control levels by 28 days after injury, corresponding to clearance of myelin debris and remyelination which was shown by eriochrome cyanine and oil red O staining of histological sections. The MTR was significantly decreased 14 days after lysolecithin injection, and remained low over the time course studied. Evidence of demyelination shown by both qT(2) and MTR lagged behind the histological evidence of demyelination. Myelin water fraction increased with remyelination, however MTR remained lower after 28 days. The difference between qT(2) and MTR may identify early remyelination.},

Remarkably, \&gt;75\% extremely (\&lt;28 weeks) preterm infants who leave the NICU do not experience major neurodevelopmental disabilities, although \&gt;50\% experience more minor challenges in communication, perception, cognition, attention, regulatory, and executive function that can adversely impact educational and social function resulting in physical, behavioral, and social health issues in adulthood. Even late premature (32--36 weeks) infants have more neurodevelopmental challenges than term infants. Although early intervention and educational programs can mitigate risks of prematurity for children's developmental trajectories, restrictive eligibility requirement and limitations on frequency and intensity mean that many premature infants must ``fail first'' to trigger services. Social challenges, including lack of family resources, unsafe neighborhoods, structural racism, and parental substance use, may compound biological vulnerabilities, yet existing services are ill-equipped to respond. An intervention system for premature infants designed according to Life Course Health Development principles would instead focus on health optimization from the start; support emerging developmental capabilities such as self-regulation and formation of reciprocal secure early relationships; be tailored to each child's unique neurodevelopmental profile and social circumstances; and be vertically, horizontally, and longitudinally integrated across levels (individual, family, community), domains (health, education), and time. Recognizing the increased demands placed on parents, it would include parental mental health supports and provision of trauma-informed care. This developmental scaffolding would incorporate parenting, health, and developmental interventions, with the aim of improved health trajectories across the whole of the life course.},

Maternal antenatal corticosteroid treatment has improved survival of preterm neonates and lowered the incidence of brain injury. After birth, exogenous surfactant administration improves lung compliance and oxygenation, resulting in reductions in the incidence of pneumothorax and of death.

In clinical practice, ID and iron supplementation are not routinely considered in the diagnostic work-up and/or as a treatment option in such conditions. Therefore, we conducted a scoping literature review of ID guidelines. Of the 58 guidelines included, only 9 included RLS, and 3 included ADHD. Ferritin was the most frequently cited biomarker, though cutoff values varied between guidelines and depending on additional factors such as age, sex, and comorbidities. Recommendations surrounding measurable iron biomarkers and cutoff values varied between guidelines; moreover, despite capturing the role of inflammation as a concept, most guidelines often did not include recommendations for how to assess this. This lack of harmonization on the interpretation of iron and inflammation biomarkers raises questions about the applicability of current guidelines in clinical practice. Further, the majority of ID guidelines in this review did not include the ID-associated disorders, ADHD and RLS. As ID can be associated with altered movement patterns, a novel consensus is needed for investigating and interpreting iron status in the context of different clinical phenotypes.},

It is therefore conceivable that also neural information processing operates close to criticality. This is further supported by the observation of power-law distributions, which are a hallmark of phase transitions. An important open question is how neural networks could remain close to a critical point while undergoing a continual change in the course of development, adaptation, learning, and more. An influential contribution was made by Bornholdt and Rohlf, introducing a generic mechanism of robust self-organized criticality in adaptive networks. Here, we address the question whether this mechanism is relevant for real neural networks. We show in a realistic model that spike-time-dependent synaptic plasticity can self-organize neural networks robustly toward criticality. Our model reproduces several empirical observations and makes testable predictions on the distribution of synaptic strength, relating them to the critical state of the network. These results suggest that the interplay between dynamics and topology may be essential for neural information processing.},

These aspects of daily life are known to be impaired after extended wake, yet, the underlying neuronal correlates have been difficult to identify. Accumulating evidence suggests that normal functioning of the brain is characterized by long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) in cortex, which are supportive for decision-making and working memory tasks. Here we assess LRTCs in resting state human EEG data during a 40-hour sleep deprivation experiment by evaluating the decay in autocorrelation and the scaling exponent of the detrended fluctuation analysis from EEG amplitude fluctuations. We find with both measures that LRTCs decline as sleep deprivation progresses. This decline becomes evident when taking changes in signal power into appropriate consideration. In contrast, the presence of strong signal power increases in some frequency bands over the course of sleep deprivation may falsely indicate LRTC changes that do not reflect the underlying long-range temporal correlation structure. Our results demonstrate the importance of sleep to maintain LRTCs in the human brain. In complex networks, LRTCs naturally emerge in the vicinity of a critical state. The observation of declining LRTCs during wake thus provides additional support for our hypothesis that sleep reorganizes cortical networks towards critical dynamics for optimal functioning.},

H was assessed in brain tissues and 13 resting state networks. H significantly increased with age, and earlier birth age contributed to lower H values. In most brain regions, H begins below 0.5 at preterm age and crosses 0.5 at term age. Motor and sensory networks demonstrated the greatest increase in H. Correlations between indirect measures of myelination and H were moderate. Overall, H appears to reflect developmental processes in the neonatal brain, as BOLD signal in the preterm infant transforms from anticorrelated to correlated but is reduced compared to term born infants.},

METHOD: This update considers the clinical, neuropsychological, diagnostic, neurobiological, and management aspects of boxing-related brain injury. RESULTS: Professional boxers with multiple bouts and repeated head blows are prone to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Repeated head blows produce rotational acceleration of the brain, diffuse axonal injury, and other neuropathological features. CTE includes motor changes such as tremor, dysarthria, and parkinsonism; cognitive changes such as mental slowing and memory deficits; and psychiatric changes such as explosive behavior, morbid jealousy, pathological intoxication, and paranoia. Screening with neuropsychological tests and neuroimaging may help predict those boxers at risk for CTE. CONCLUSIONS: Boxing results in a spectrum of CTE ranging from mild, nonprogressive motor changes to dementia pugilistica. Recent emphasis on safety in the ring, rehabilitation techniques, and other interventions do not eliminate the risk for CTE. For this reason, there is an active movement to ban boxing.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the reproducibility of myelin water fraction (MWF) and geometric mean T2 (GMT2 ), which are in vivo markers of pathological changes underlying disability and progression in diseases such as multiple sclerosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five healthy volunteers were scanned twice within 24 hours at six different sites using the same manufacturer's 3T magnetic resonance (MR) system. T2 distributions were produced by fitting multiecho 3D T2 data using non-negative least squares, with stimulated echo correction. MWF, the fraction of signal with T2 between 15 and 40 msec to the entire signal, and GMT2 , the mean T2 on a logarithmic scale from T2 between 40 and 200 msec, were examined in white matter. RESULTS: Intrasite coefficients of variation (COVs) were low (mean 3.99\% for MWF and 0.51\% for GMT2 ), as were intersite COVs (mean 4.68\% for MWF, 0.31\% for GMT2 ). Scan-rescan intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) (0.76 for MWF and 0.93 for GMT2 ) and Bland-Altman plots indicated good agreement between single site scans. Intersite ICCs were relatively high (0.69 for MWF and 0.92 for GMT2 ), revealing good intersite reliability. CONCLUSION: MWF and GMT2 measures are reproducible between scans and across sites with an equivalent MR scanner and sequence protocol. Multicenter clinical trials using quantitative T2 relaxation are feasible.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To review the probable physical, physiologic mechanisms that result in the medical and neuropsychologic complications of diffuse axonal injury (DAI)-associated traumatic brain injury (TBI). DATA SOURCES: Various materials were accessed: MEDLINE, textbooks, scientific presentations, and current ongoing research that has been recently reported. STUDY SELECTION: Included were scientific studies involving TBI, particularly direct injury to the axons and glia of the central nervous system (CNS) in both in vitro and in vivo models. These studies include pathologic findings in humans as well as the medical complications and behavioral outcomes of DAI. Studies that addressed animal models of DAI as well as cellular and/or tissue models of neuronal injury were emphasized. The review also covered work on the physical properties of materials involved in the transmission of energy associated with prolonged acceleration-deceleration injuries. DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were selected with regard to those that addressed the mechanism of TBI associated with DAI and direct injury to the axon within the CNS. The material was generally the emphasis of the article and was extracted by multiple observers. Studies that correlate the above findings with the clinical picture of DAI were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Concepts were developed by the authors based on the current scientific findings and theories of DAI. The synthesis of these concepts involves expertise in physical science, basic science concepts of cellular injury to the CNS, acute medical indicators of DAI, neuropsychologic indicators of DAI, and rehabilitation outcomes from TBI. CONCLUSIONS: The term DAI is a misnomer. It is not a diffuse injury to the whole brain, rather it is predominant in discrete regions of the brain following high-speed, long-duration deceleration injuries. DAI is a consistent feature of TBI from transportation-related injuries as well as some sports injuries. The pathology of DAI in humans is characterized histologically by widespread damage to the axons of the brainstem, parasagittal white matter of the cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, and the gray-white matter junctions of the cerebral cortex. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans taken initially after injury are often normal. The deformation of the brain due to plastic flow of the neural structures associated with DAI explains the micropathologic findings, radiologic findings, and medical and neuropsychologic complications from this type of injury mechanism. There is evidence that the types of cellular injury in TBI (DAI, anoxic, contusion, hemorrhagic, perfusion-reperfusion) should be differentiated, as all may involve different receptors and biochemical pathways that impact recovery. These differing mechanisms of cellular injury involving specific biochemical pathways and locations of injury may, in part, explain the lack of success in drug trials to ameliorate TBI.},

  abstract = {Purpose: to investigate the mutual agreement of T2- and susceptibility-based methods as well as their agreement with jugular catheterization, for quantifying venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) at a broad range of brain oxygenation levels. Methods: SvO2 measurements using T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) and susceptibility-based oximetry (SBO) were performed in 13 healthy subjects under room air, hypoxia and hypercapnia conditions. Agreement between TRUST and SBO was quantitatively evaluated. In two of the subjects, TRUST and SBO were compared against the clinical gold standard, co-oximeter measurement via internal jugular vein catheterization. Results: Absolute SvO2 measurements using TRUST and SBO were highly correlated across a range of saturations from 45 to 84\% (Pearson r = 0.91, P {$<$} 0.0001). SvO2-TRUST was significantly lower than SvO2-SBO under hypoxia and room air conditions, but the two were comparable under hypercapnia. TRUST demonstrated a larger SvO2 increase under hypercapnia than SBO. TRUST had good agreement with jugular catheterization under hypercapnia but significantly underestimated SvO2 under room air and hypoxia. The agreement between SvO2-SBO and the reference did not depend on the physiological state. Conclusion: A systematic bias was observed between T2- and susceptibility-based methods that depended on the oxygenation state. In-vivo validation with jugular catheterization indicated potential underestimation of TRUST under room air and hypoxia conditions. Our findings suggested that caution should be taken for comparison of absolute SvO2 measurements using either TRUST or SBO.},

The mathematical model used to analyze the data consists of two compartments and accounted for production and egress of water of metabolism in the tissue, recirculating water of metabolism, and the arterial, venous, and capillary content of [O-15]O2 in the brain. We validated our technique in baboons by comparing the PET-measured E with E measured using an intracarotid injection of [O-15]O2. The correlation between these two techniques was excellent. Mathematical simulations were done to examine the effect of errors in CBV, CBF, and recirculating water of metabolism on the measurement of E and CMRO2. The technique was implemented on five normal human subjects in whom the global CMRO2 was 2.93 \textpm{} 0.37 (s.d.) ml/min{$\cdot$}100 g.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter injury caused by cerebral hypoperfusion may contribute to the pathophysiology of vascular dementia and stroke, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully defined. Here, we test the hypothesis that oxidative stress interferes with endogenous white matter repair by disrupting renewal processes mediated by oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). METHODS: In vitro, primary rat OPCs were exposed to sublethal CoCl2 for 7 days to induce prolonged chemical hypoxic stress. Then, OPC proliferation/differentiation was assessed. In vivo, prolonged cerebral hypoperfusion was induced by bilateral common carotid artery stenosis in mice. Then, reactive oxygen species production, myelin density, oligodendrocyte versus OPC counts, and cognitive function were evaluated. To block oxidative stress, OPCs and mice were treated with the radical scavenger edaravone. RESULTS: Prolonged chemical hypoxic stress suppressed OPC differentiation in vitro. Radical scavenging with edaravone ameliorated these effects. After 28 days of cerebral hypoperfusion in vivo, reactive oxygen species levels were increased in damaged white matter, along with the suppression of OPC-to-oligodendrocyte differentiation and loss of myelin staining. Concomitantly, mice showed functional deficits in working memory. Radical scavenging with edaravone rescued OPC differentiation, ameliorated myelin loss, and restored working memory function. CONCLUSIONS: Our proof-of-concept study demonstrates that after prolonged cerebral hypoperfusion, oxidative stress interferes with white matter repair by disrupting OPC renewal mechanisms. Radical scavengers may provide a potential therapeutic approach for white matter injury in vascular dementia and stroke.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study was undertaken to determine the pathologic basis of subtle abnormalities in magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters observed in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in multiple sclerosis brains. METHODS: Brain tissues were obtained through a rapid postmortem protocol that included in situ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Four types of MRI-defined regions of interest (ROIs) were analyzed: (1) regions that were abnormal on all images (T2T1MTR lesions); (2) NAWM regions with slightly abnormal MTR located close to white matter lesions (sa-WM Close); (3) NAWM regions with slightly abnormal MTR located far from lesions (sa-WM Far); and (4) NAWM regions with normal MTR (NAWM). Immunohistochemical analysis for each ROI comprised immunostaining for myelin, axonal markers, activated microglia/macrophages, astrocytes, plasma proteins, and blood vessels. RESULTS: Forty-eight ROIs from 4 secondary progressive MS brains were analyzed. sa-WM Close ROIs were associated with significantly more axonal swellings. There were more enlarged major histocompatibility complex II(+) microglia and macrophages detected in sa-WM Far, sa-WM Close, and T2T1MTR lesions than in NAWM. Across all ROIs, MTR and DTI measures were moderately correlated with myelin density, axonal area, and axonal counts. Excluding T2T1MTR lesions from analysis revealed that MTR and DTI measures in nonlesional white matter (WM) were correlated with activated microglia, but not with axonal or myelin integrity. INTERPRETATION: The pathologic substrates for MRI abnormalities in NAWM vary based on distance from focal WM lesions. Close to WM lesions, axonal pathology and microglial activation may explain subtle MRI changes. Distant from lesions, microglial activation associated with proximity to cortical lesions might underlie MRI abnormalities.},

This atlas is based on multiarchitectonic parcellation in sections parallel or perpendicular to the standard intercommissural reference plane. The calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV), calbindin D-28K (CB), and calretinin (CR) were used as neurochemical markers to further characterize thalamic nuclei and delimit subterritories of functional significance for stereotactic explorations. Their overall distribution reveals a subcompartmentalization of thalamic nuclei into several groups. Predominant PV immunostaining characterizes primary somatosensory, visual and auditory nuclei, the ventral lateral posterior nucleus, reticular nucleus (R), and to a lesser degree also, lateral part of the centre median nucleus, and anterior, lateral, and inferior divisions of the pulvinar complex. In contrast, CB immunoreactivity is prevalent in medial thalamic nuclei (intralaminar and midline), the posterior complex, ventral posterior inferior nucleus, the ventral lateral anterior nucleus, ventral anterior, and ventral medial nuclei. The complementary distributions of PV and CB appear to correlate with distinct lemniscal and spinothalamic somatosensory pathways and to cerebellar and pallidal motor territories, respectively. Calretinin, while overlapping with CB in medial thalamic territories, is also expressed in R and limbic associated anterior group nuclei that contain little or no CB. Preliminary analysis indicates that interindividual nuclear variations cannot easily be taken into account by standardization procedures. Nevertheless, some corrections in antero-posterior coordinates in relation to different intercommissural distances are proposed.},

The Canadian Neonatal Follow-Up Network (CNFUN) afforded an opportunity to study the outcomes of extremely preterm children. The purpose of this study was to compare 18-month corrected age (CA) motor outcomes of extremely preterm infants with parent-reported functional outcomes at 3 years CA. CNFUN data of 1376 infants were used to conduct chi-square analyses to compare Bayley-III motor scores (composite, gross, and fine motor) at 18 months CA with parent-reported Ages and Stages Questionnaire motor scores (gross and fine motor) at 3 years CA. The correlation of motor scores at 18-months CA with parent-reported gross and fine motor scores at 3 years CA was also examined. We found that 1 in 5 infants scoring within or above the average range on the Bayley-III had parent-reported functional fine and gross motor difficulties at 3 years CA. Bayley-III scores were only moderately correlated with functional motor outcomes. Results of the study suggest that the Bayley-III at 18 months CA was able to detect the majority of infants with motor problems, but not all; therefore, ongoing follow-up of extremely preterm infants is required. The Bayley-III motor composite score has greater clinical utility compared to sub-scale scores.},

Greater signal attenuation (faster diffusion) was observed when the relative orientation of white matter tracts to the diffusion-sensitizing gradient was parallel as compared to that obtained with a perpendicular alignment. These effects were seen on both premortem and immediate postmortem images obtained in all axial, sagittal, and coronal views. Potential applications of this MR imaging technique included the stereospecific evaluation of white matter in the brain and spinal cord and in the characterization of demyelinating and dysmyelinating diseases.},

  abstract = {In this work, we focus on explicitly nonlinear relationships in functional networks. We introduce a technique using normalized mutual information (NMI) that calculates the nonlinear relationship between different brain regions. We demonstrate our proposed approach using simulated data and then apply it to a dataset previously studied by Damaraju et al. This resting-state fMRI data included 151 schizophrenia patients and 163 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. We first decomposed these data using group independent component analysis (ICA) and yielded 47 functionally relevant intrinsic connectivity networks. Our analysis showed a modularized nonlinear relationship among brain functional networks that was particularly noticeable in the sensory and visual cortex. Interestingly, the modularity appears both meaningful and distinct from that revealed by the linear approach. Group analysis identified significant differences in explicitly nonlinear functional network connectivity (FNC) between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, particularly in the visual cortex, with controls showing more nonlinearity (i.e., higher normalized mutual information between time courses with linear relationships removed) in most cases. Certain domains, including subcortical and auditory, showed relatively less nonlinear FNC (i.e., lower normalized mutual information), whereas links between the visual and other domains showed evidence of substantial nonlinear and modular properties. Overall, these results suggest that quantifying nonlinear dependencies of functional connectivity may provide a complementary and potentially important tool for studying brain function by exposing relevant variation that is typically ignored. Beyond this, we propose a method that captures both linear and nonlinear effects in a ``boosted'' approach. This method increases the sensitivity to group differences compared to the standard linear approach, at the cost of being unable to separate linear and nonlinear effects.},

DESIGN: Multivariable logistic regression to select variables that were independently associated with two patient outcomes. Two models designed: "basic" model (demographic and clinical variables only) and "CT" model (basic model plus results of computed tomography). The models were subsequently developed for high and low-middle income countries separately. SETTING: Medical Research Council (MRC) CRASH Trial. SUBJECTS: 10,008 patients with traumatic brain injury. Models externally validated in a cohort of 8509. RESULTS: The basic model included four predictors: age, Glasgow coma scale, pupil reactivity, and the presence of major extracranial injury. The CT model also included the presence of petechial haemorrhages, obliteration of the third ventricle or basal cisterns, subarachnoid bleeding, midline shift, and non-evacuated haematoma. In the derivation sample the models showed excellent discrimination (C statistic above 0.80). The models showed good calibration graphically. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test also indicated good calibration, except for the CT model in low-middle income countries. External validation for unfavourable outcome at six months in high income countries showed that basic and CT models had good discrimination (C statistic 0.77 for both models) but poorer calibration. CONCLUSION: Simple prognostic models can be used to obtain valid predictions of relevant outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury.},

  abstract = {A celebrated and controversial hypothesis conjectures that some biological systems --parts, aspects, or groups of them-- may extract important functional benefits from operating at the edge of instability, halfway between order and disorder, i.e. in the vicinity of the critical point of a phase transition. Criticality has been argued to provide biological systems with an optimal balance between robustness against perturbations and flexibility to adapt to changing conditions, as well as to confer on them optimal computational capabilities, huge dynamical repertoires, unparalleled sensitivity to stimuli, etc. Criticality, with its concomitant scale invariance, can be conjectured to emerge in living systems as the result of adaptive and evolutionary processes that, for reasons to be fully elucidated, select for it as a template upon which higher layers of complexity can rest. This hypothesis is very suggestive as it proposes that criticality could constitute a general and common organizing strategy in biology stemming from the physics of phase transitions. However, despite its thrilling implications, this is still in its embryonic state as a well-founded theory and, as such, it has elicited some healthy skepticism. From the experimental side, the advent of high-throughput technologies has created new prospects in the exploration of biological systems, and empirical evidence in favor of criticality has proliferated, with examples ranging from endogenous brain activity and gene-expression patterns, to flocks of birds and insect-colony foraging, to name but a few...},

  abstract = {In recent years, interest has grown in the potential for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of venous oxygen saturation (Yv) to improve neurological risk prediction. T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) is an MRI technique which has revealed changes in Yv in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA). However, prior studies comparing Yv in patients with SCA relative to healthy controls have reported opposing results depending on whether the calibration model, developed to convert blood T2 to Yv, is based on healthy human hemoglobin (HbA), bovine hemoglobin (HbBV) or sickle hemoglobin (HbS). MRI Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) is an alternative technique that may hold promise for estimating Yv in SCA as blood magnetic susceptibility is linearly dependent upon Yv, and no significant difference has been found between the magnetic susceptibility of HbA and HbS. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare estimates of Yv using QSM and TRUST with five published calibration models in healthy controls and patients with SCA. 17 patients with SCA and 13 healthy controls underwent MRI. Susceptibility maps were calculated from a multi-parametric mapping acquisition and Yv was calculated from the mean susceptibility in a region of interest in the superior sagittal sinus. TRUST estimates of T2, within a similar but much smaller region, were converted to Yv using five different calibration models. Correlation and Bland-Altman analyses were performed to compare estimates of Yv between TRUST and QSM methods. For each method, t-tests were also used to explore group-wise differences between patients with SCA and healthy controls. In healthy controls, significant correlations were observed between QSM and TRUST measures of Yv, while in SCA, there were no such correlations. The magnitude and direction of group-wise differences in Yv varied with method. The TRUST-HbBV and QSM methods suggested decreased Yv in SCA relative to healthy controls, while the TRUST-HbS (p {$<$} 0.01) and TRUST-HbA models suggested increased Yv in SCA as in previous studies. Further validation of all MRI measures of Yv, relative to ground truth measures such as O15 PET and jugular vein catheterization, is required in SCA before QSM or TRUST methods can be considered for neurological risk prediction.},

In the present longitudinal study, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess white matter (WM) fiber tract integrity within 2 days, 2 weeks, and 2 months of concussive injury. Participants were right-handed male varsity contact-sport athletes (20.2\textpm 1.0 years of age) with a medically diagnosed SRC (no loss of consciousness). They were compared to right-handed male varsity non-contact-sport athletes serving as controls (19.9\textpm 1.7 years). We found significantly increased radial diffusivity (RD) in concussed athletes (n=12; paired t-test, tract-based spatial statistics; p{$<$}0.025) at 2 days, when compared to the 2-week postinjury time point. The increase was found in a cluster of right hemisphere voxels, spanning the posterior limb of the internal capsule (IC), the retrolenticular part of the IC, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (sagittal stratum), and the anterior thalamic radiation. Post-hoc, univariate, between-group (controls vs. concussed), mixed-effects analysis of the cluster showed significantly higher RD at 2 days (p=0.002), as compared to the controls, with a trend in the same direction at 2 months (p=0.11). Results for fractional anisotropy (FA) in the same cluster showed a similar, but inverted, pattern; FA was decreased at 2 days and at 2 months postinjury, when compared to healthy controls. At 2 weeks postinjury, no statistical differences between concussed and control athletes were found with regard to either RD or FA. These results support the hypothesis of increased RD and reduced FA within 72\,h postinjury, followed by recovery that may extend beyond 2 weeks. RD appears to be a sensitive measure of concussive injury.},

Multiple approaches can now determine aspects of anatomic and neurochemical changes in brain, and have been utilized effectively in Rett Syndrome patients to understand the biological basis of this neurodevelopmental disorder. Studies performed at our institute include volumetric analyses of MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), cerebral blood flow measurements with MRI, and positron emission tomography scans (PET). These studies have provided considerable insight into mechanisms underlying the clinical features of this disease. Volumetric analyses suggest that decreased brain volume in RS results from global reductions in both gray and white matter of the brain. A selective vulnerability of the frontal lobes is evidenced by the preferential reduction of blood flow, increased choline and reduced n-acetyl aspartate (NAA) by MRS, and increased glucose uptake in these same regions as shown by ( 18 F)-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scans. We hypothesize that the increased glucose uptake relates to increased glutamate cycling in synapses. The resulting neuroexcitotoxic injury to the developing brain contributes to the seizures, behavioral disturbance and respiratory irregularities commonly seen in phases 1 and 2 of this disorder. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here we studied cortical thickness in very preterm born individuals and controls in mid-adolescence (mean age 15 years) and beginning of adulthood (mean age 20 years), as well as longitudinal changes between the two time points. Using univariate approaches, we showed both increases and decreases in cortical thickness in very preterm born individuals compared to controls. Specifically (1) very preterm born adolescents displayed extensive areas of greater cortical thickness, especially in occipitotemporal and prefrontal cortices, differences which decreased substantially by early adulthood; (2) at both time points, very preterm-born participants showed smaller cortical thickness, especially in parahippocampal and insular regions. We then employed a multivariate approach (support vector machine) to study spatially discriminating features between the two groups, which achieved a mean accuracy of 86.5\%. The spatially distributed regions in which cortical thickness best discriminated between the groups (top 5\%) included temporal, occipitotemporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices. Within these spatially distributed regions (top 1\%), longitudinal changes in cortical thickness in left temporal pole, right occipitotemporal gyrus and left superior parietal lobe were significantly associated with scores on language-based tests of executive function. These results describe alterations in cortical thickness development in preterm-born individuals in their second decade of life, with implications for high-order cognitive processing.},

Because CDKL5 is subjected to X chromosome inactivation (XCI), individual cells from CDKL5 mutation girls either express the wild-type or mutant allele, likely resulting in different consequences at both the cellular and molecular levels. To identify these consequences, we carried out gene expression profiling on clonal populations derived from primary cultures of three patients' fibroblasts either expressing the wild-type or mutant allele. A total of 16 up-regulated and 20 down-regulated genes were identified. The differentially expressed gene products, mostly involved in differentiation and oxidative stress may be related to a mechanism underlying mental retardation and epilepsy. Among these, the apoptosis signal-regulated kinase MAP3K5 expression was found to be altered in non-neuronal, but also in neuronal CDKL5-deficient cells. Due to the fact that MAP3K5 activates MAP kinase pathway, which mediates signals leading to both differentiation and survival in neuronal cells, we suggest that a CDKL5 deficit may induce changes in synaptic plasticity in the patient's brain.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 19 pregnant subjects, with a mean gestational age of 31.6 \textpm{} 4.7 weeks were imaged using a modified susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) sequence. Data quality was first assessed for feasibility of oxygen saturation measurement, and data from five subjects (mean \textpm{} std gestational age of 33.7 \textpm{} 3.6 weeks) were then chosen for further quantitative analysis. SWI phase in the superior sagittal sinus was used to evaluate oxygen saturation using the principles of MR susceptometry. Systematic error in the measured Y(v) values was studied through simulations. RESULTS: Simulations showed that the systematic error in Yv depended upon the assumed angle of the vessel, \texttheta, relative to the main magnetic field and the error in that vessel angle {$\delta\theta$}. For the typical vessel angle of \texttheta{} = 30{$^\circ$} encountered in the fetal data analyzed, a {$\delta\theta$} as large as \textpm 20{$^\circ$} led to an absolute error, {$\delta$}Yv, of less than 11\%. The measured mean oxygen saturation across the five fetuses was 66\% \textpm{} 9.4\%. This average cerebral venous blood oxygenation value is in close agreement with values in the published literature. CONCLUSION: We have reported the first in vivo measurement of human fetal cerebral venous oxygen saturation using MRI.},

  abstract = {Smoking has now been identified as a definite cause of cancer at many sites (Table 2). Of all cancers in the United States, 30\% could be prevented if cigarette smoking were eliminated. Organs in direct contact with smoke--the oral cavity, esophagus, lung, and bronchus--are at the greatest risk of malignancy among smokers. As many as 90\% of these cancers are attributable to smoking. Organs and tissues distant from smoke are also at some increased risk. Among smokers, rates of cancer of the cervix, pancreas, bladder, kidney, stomach, and hematopoietic tissue are increased 50\% to 200\% over rates in nonsmokers. Risk of cancer at all sites increases with increasing exposure to cigarette smoke. Cigarette smoke contains potent carcinogens that influence carcinogenesis at both early and late stages. These carcinogens can interact with other exposures, such as alcohol, to synergistically increase the risk of cancer. The adverse carcinogenic effects of cigarette smoking, however, can be reduced for all smokers if tobacco use is stopped. The prevalence of smoking among the US population as a whole has declined from 40\% in 1965 to 29\% in 1987. This progress against the epidemic of tobacco use has already produced a decrease in the occurrence of the most common tumor among men, lung cancer. Unfortunately, the decline in smoking prevalence and cancer incidence has not occurred equally across US populations. Death rates of lung cancer in women continue to rise, and, based upon current smoking patterns, these rates will continue to increase into the next century. The challenge to physicians and public health workers is compelling and immediate: Abstaining from smoking is the single most effective way to reduce an individual's risk of cancer.},

  abstract = {Although diffuse axonal injury (DAI) has been described as a major form of primary damage to the brain in blunt head injury, there has been no systematic study of the pathological changes in different regions of the brain. In this study, 22 cases of DAI were comprehensively examined histologically in the following areas: corpus callosum, internal capsule, superior cerebellar peduncles, cerebral white matter, fornix, rostral brain stem and globus pallidus, with a total of 17 standard blocks in each case. Sections were stained for axons with Glees and Marsland and neurofilament immunostaining and myelin with luxol fast blue and myelin basic protein immunostaining, and axonal retraction balls and myelin globoids were counted. Neurofilament immunostaining was superior to Glees and Marsland in both the positivity rates and the actual scores. Small myelin globoids were identified by the myelin stains, probably as a form of myelin damage secondary to axonal disruption. Such acute myelin damage was previously undescribed. There was no significant difference in both positivity rates and the scores obtained for luxol fast blue and myelin basic protein. Of all the regions of the brain examined, the internal capsule, corpus callosum and superior cerebellar peduncles yielded the highest counts of axonal balls as well as the highest incidences. It is recommended that in cases of DAI, these three regions of the brain should be examined most profitably with neurofilament immunostaining supplemented with a myelin stain.},

It has been reported that the R2* and phase values originating from the gradient-echo sequence could both reflect the iron and myelination. The aim of this study was to investigate age-related changes of R2* and phase value, and compare their performances for monitoring iron deposition and WM maturation in infant brains. METHODS: 56 infants were examined by enhanced T2 star weighted angiography (ESWAN) and diffusion tensor imaging in the 1.5T MRI system. The R2* and phase values were measured from the deep gray nuclei and WM. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured only in the WM regions. Correlation analyses were performed to explore the relation among the two parameters (R2* and phase values) and postmenstrual age (PMA), previously published iron concentrations as well as FA values. RESULTS: We found significantly positive correlations between the R2* values and PMA in both of the gray nuclei and WM. Moreover, R2* values had a positive correlation with the iron reference concentrations in the deep gray nuclei and the FA in the WM. However, phase values only had the positive correlation with PMA and FA in the internal capsule, and no significant correlation with PMA and iron content in the deep gray nuclei. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the phase values, R2* may be a preferable method to estimate the iron deposition and WM maturation in infant brains.},

  abstract = {Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) remains a challenge to accurately assess with conventional neuroimaging. Recent research holds out the promise that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be used to predict recovery in mTBI patients. Unlike computed tomography or conventional magnetic resonance imaging, DTI is sensitive to microstructural axonal injury, the neuropathology that is thought to be most responsible for the persistent cognitive and behavioral impairments that often occur after mTBI. Through the use of newer DTI analysis techniques such as automated region of interest analysis, tract-based voxel-wise analysis, and quantitative tractography, researchers have shown that frontal and temporal association white matter pathways are most frequently damaged in mTBI and that the microstructural integrity of these tracts correlates with behavioral and cognitive measures. Future longitudinal DTI studies are needed to elucidate how symptoms and the microstructural pathology evolve over time. Moving forward, large-scale investigations will ascertain whether DTI can serve as a predictive imaging biomarker for long-term neurocognitive deficits after mTBI that would be of value for triaging patients to clinical trials of experimental cognitive enhancement therapies and rehabilitation methods, as well as for monitoring their response to these interventions.},

We hypothesized that for mild TBI, DTI measures of DAI would correlate with impairments in reaction time, whereas the number of focal lesions on conventional 3T MR imaging would not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four adult patients with mild TBI with persistent symptoms were assessed for DAI by quantifying traumatic microhemorrhages detected on a conventional set of T2*-weighted gradient-echo images and by DTI measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) within a set of a priori regions of interest. FA values 2.5 SDs below the region average, based on a group of 26 healthy control adults, were coded as exhibiting DAI. RESULTS: DTI measures revealed several predominant regions of damage including the anterior corona radiata (41\% of the patients), uncinate fasciculus (29\%), genu of the corpus callosum (21\%), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (21\%), and cingulum bundle (18\%). The number of damaged white matter structures as quantified by DTI was significantly correlated with mean reaction time on a simple cognitive task (r = 0.49, P = .012). In contradistinction, the number of traumatic microhemorrhages was uncorrelated with reaction time (r = -0.08, P = .71). CONCLUSION: Microstructural white matter lesions detected by DTI correlate with persistent cognitive deficits in mild TBI, even in populations in which conventional measures do not. DTI measures may thus contribute additional diagnostic information related to DAI.},

The  presence of these correlations has led to the proposal that they might form a  key element of the neural code. Specifically, they might act as an extra  channel for information, carrying messages about events in the outside world  that are not carried by other aspects of the spike trains, such as firing  rate. Currently, there is no general consensus about whether this proposal  applies to real spike trains in the nervous system. This is largely because it  has been hard to separate information carried in correlations from that not  carried in correlations. Here we propose a framework for performing this  separation. Specifically, we derive an information-theoretic cost function  that measures how much harder it is to decode neuronal responses when  correlations are ignored than when they are taken into account. This cost  function can be readily applied to real neuronal data.},

  abstract = {Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), although often presenting without the gross structural abnormalities seen in more severe forms of brain trauma, can nonetheless result in lingering cognitive and behavioral problems along with subtle alterations in brain structure and function. Repeated injuries are associated with brain atrophy and dementia in the form of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The mechanisms underlying these dysfunctions are poorly understood. There is a growing body of evidence that brain iron is abnormal after TBI, and brain iron has also been implicated in a host of neurodegenerative disorders. The purpose of this article is to review evidence about the function of iron in the pathophysiology of mTBI and the role that advanced imaging modalities can play in further elucidating said function. MRI techniques sensitive to field inhomogeneities provide supporting evidence for both deep gray matter non-heme iron accumulation as well as focal microhemorrhage resulting from mTBI. In addition, there is evidence that iron may contribute to pathology after mTBI through a number of mechanisms, including generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), exacerbation of oxidative stress from other sources, and encouragement of tau phosphorylation and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Finally, recent animal studies suggest that iron may serve as a therapeutic target in mitigating the effects of mTBI. However, research on the presence and role of iron in mTBI and CTE is still relatively sparse, and further work is necessary to elucidate issues such as the sources of increased iron and the chain of secondary injury.},

Oximetry is a technique for the assessment of blood oxygenation by measurements of light transmission through the blood, which is based on the different absorption spectra of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. Oxygen saturation in arterial blood provides information on the adequacy of respiration and is routinely measured in clinical settings, utilizing pulse oximetry. Oxygen saturation, in venous blood (SvO2) and in the entire blood in a tissue (StO2), is related to the blood supply to the tissue, and several oximetric techniques have been developed for their assessment. SvO2 can be measured non-invasively in the fingers, making use of modified pulse oximetry, and in the retina, using the modified Beer-Lambert Law. StO2 is measured in peripheral muscle and cerebral tissue by means of various modes of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), utilizing the relative transparency of infrared light in muscle and cerebral tissue. The primary problem of oximetry is the discrimination between absorption by hemoglobin and scattering by tissue elements in the attenuation measurement, and the various techniques developed for isolating the absorption effect are presented in the current review, with their limitations.},

Here we used specific antibodies against N-acetylaspartate and immunocytochemistry of carbodiimide-fixed adult rodent brain to show that, besides staining of neuronal cell bodies in the grey matter, N-acetylaspartate labelling was present in oligodendrocytes/myelin in white matter tracts. Immunoelectron microscopy of the rat hippocampus showed that N-acetylaspartate was concentrated in the myelin. Also neuronal cell bodies and axons contained significant amounts of N-acetylaspartate, while synaptic elements and astrocytes were low in N-acetylaspartate. Mitochondria in axons and neuronal cell bodies contained higher levels of N-acetylaspartate compared to the cytosol, compatible with synthesis of N-acetylaspartate in mitochondria. In aspartoacylase knockout mice, in which catabolism of N-acetylaspartate is blocked, the levels of N-acetylaspartate were largely increased in oligodendrocytes/myelin. In these mice, the highest myelin concentration of N-acetylaspartate was found in the cerebellum, a region showing overt dysmyelination. In organotypic cortical slice cultures there was no evidence for N-acetylaspartate-induced myelin toxicity, supporting the notion that myelin damage is induced by the lack of N-acetylaspartate for lipid production. Our findings also implicate that N-acetylaspartate signals on magnetic resonance spectroscopy reflect not only vital neurons but also vital oligodendrocytes/myelin.},

ANOVA was used to assess group differences in frontal, parietal, and cerebellar regions. For regions differing between groups (p {$<$} 0.01), linear regression examined the relationship between EF scores and regional FA and MD. Anisotropy and diffusivity in frontal and parietal lobe white matter structures were associated with EF scores in MCI and only frontal lobe structures in AD. EF was more strongly associated with FA than MD. The relationship between EF and anisotropy and diffusivity was strongest in MCI.

Phase was correlated with brain iron concentration in putamen (R2 = 0.76), caudate (0.72), motor cortex (0.68), globus pallidus (0.59) (all p {$<$} 0.001), and frontal cortex (R2 = 0.19, p = 0.05), but not in white matter (R2 = 0.05,p = 0.34).

These results suggest that magnetic resonance phase reflects iron-induced differences in brain tissue susceptibility in gray matter. The lack of correlation in white matter may reflect important differences between gray and white matter in the cellular distribution and the metabolic functions of iron.

To further explore the source of magnetic susceptibility effect, the contribution of tissue iron to the orientation dependent R2(*) contrast was investigated. Additionally, the effects of temperature on R2(*) and orientation dependent R2(*) contrasts were studied to understand the differences reported between a fixed specimen at room temperature and in vivo at body temperature. The results suggest that the B0 dependent R2(*) variation is better explained by the magnetic susceptibility-based model with susceptibility anisotropy. However, extracting tissue iron did not reduce the orientation dependent R2(*) contrast, suggesting iron is not the origin of the contrast. This leaves susceptibility effects from myelin as the most probable origin of the contrast. Temperature showed large contribution on both R2(*) and orientation dependent R2(*) contrasts, explaining a portion of the contrast difference between the in-vivo and in-vitro conditions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and is associated with long-term physical, neurodevelopmental, and socioeconomic effects. This study updated national preterm birth rates and trends, plus novel estimates by gestational age subgroups, to inform progress towards global health goals and targets, and aimed to update country, regional, and global estimates of preterm birth for 2020 in addition to trends between 2010 and 2020. METHODS: We systematically searched population-based, nationally representative data on preterm birth from Jan 1, 2010, to Dec 31, 2020 and study data (26 March-14 April, 2021) for countries and areas with no national-level data. The analysis included 679 data points (86\% nationally representative administrative data [582 of 679 data points]) from 103 countries and areas (62\% of countries and areas having nationally representative administrative data [64 of 103 data points]). A Bayesian hierarchical regression was used for estimating country-level preterm rates, which incoporated country-specific intercepts, low birthweight as a covariate, non-linear time trends, and bias adjustments based on a data quality categorisation, and other indicators such as method of gestational age estimation. FINDINGS: An estimated 13{$\cdot$}4 million (95\% credible interval [CrI] 12{$\cdot$}3-15{$\cdot$}2 million) newborn babies were born preterm ({$<$}37 weeks) in 2020 (9{$\cdot$}9\% of all births [95\% CrI 9{$\cdot$}1-11{$\cdot$}2]) compared with 13{$\cdot$}8 million (12{$\cdot$}7-15{$\cdot$}5 million) in 2010 (9{$\cdot$}8\% of all births [9{$\cdot$}0-11{$\cdot$}0]) worldwide. The global annual rate of reduction was estimated at -0{$\cdot$}14\% from 2010 to 2020. In total, 55{$\cdot$}6\% of total livebirths are in southern Asia (26{$\cdot$}8\% [36\hphantom{,}099\hphantom{,}000 of 134\hphantom{,}767\hphantom{,}000]) and sub-Saharan Africa (28{$\cdot$}7\% [38\hphantom{,}819\hphantom{,}300 of 134\hphantom{,}767\hphantom{,}000]), yet these two regions accounted for approximately 65\% (8\hphantom{,}692\hphantom{,}000 of 13\hphantom{,}376\hphantom{,}200) of all preterm births globally in 2020. Of the 33 countries and areas in the highest data quality category, none were in southern Asia or sub-Saharan Africa compared with 94\% (30 of 32 countries) in high-income countries and areas. Worldwide from 2010 to 2020, approximately 15\% of all preterm births occurred at less than 32 weeks of gestation, requiring more neonatal care ({$<$}28 weeks: 4{$\cdot$}2\%, 95\% CI 3{$\cdot$}1-5{$\cdot$}0, 567\hphantom{,}800 [410\hphantom{,}200-663\hphantom{,}200 newborn babies]); 28-32 weeks: 10{$\cdot$}4\% [9{$\cdot$}5-10{$\cdot$}6], 1\hphantom{,}392\hphantom{,}500 [1\hphantom{,}274\hphantom{,}800-1\hphantom{,}422\hphantom{,}600 newborn babies]). INTERPRETATION: There has been no measurable change in preterm birth rates over the last decade at global level. Despite increasing facility birth rates and substantial focus on routine health data systems, there remain many missed opportunities to improve preterm birth data. Gaps in national routine data for preterm birth are most marked in regions of southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, which also have the highest estimated burden of preterm births. Countries need to prioritise programmatic investments to prevent preterm birth and to ensure evidence-based quality care when preterm birth occurs. Investments in improving data quality are crucial so that preterm birth data can be improved and used for action and accountability processes.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We present the results of the autopsy of a retired professional football player that revealed neuropathological changes consistent with long-term repetitive concussive brain injury. This case draws attention to the need for further studies in the cohort of retired National Football League players to elucidate the neuropathological sequelae of repeated mild traumatic brain injury in professional football. METHODS: The patient's premortem medical history included symptoms of cognitive impairment, a mood disorder, and parkinsonian symptoms. There was no family history of Alzheimer's disease or any other head trauma outside football. A complete autopsy with a comprehensive neuropathological examination was performed on the retired National Football League player approximately 12 years after retirement. He died suddenly as a result of coronary atherosclerotic disease. Studies included determination of apolipoprotein E genotype. RESULTS: Autopsy confirmed the presence of coronary atherosclerotic disease with dilated cardiomyopathy. The brain demonstrated no cortical atrophy, cortical contusion, hemorrhage, or infarcts. The substantia nigra revealed mild pallor with mild dropout of pigmented neurons. There was mild neuronal dropout in the frontal, parietal, and temporal neocortex. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy was evident with many diffuse amyloid plaques as well as sparse neurofibrillary tangles and tau-positive neuritic threads in neocortical areas. There were no neurofibrillary tangles or neuropil threads in the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex. Lewy bodies were absent. The apolipoprotein E genotype was E3/E3. CONCLUSION: This case highlights potential long-term neurodegenerative outcomes in retired professional National Football League players subjected to repeated mild traumatic brain injury. The prevalence and pathoetiological mechanisms of these possible adverse long-term outcomes and their relation to duration of years of playing football have not been sufficiently studied. We recommend comprehensive clinical and forensic approaches to understand and further elucidate this emergent professional sport hazard.},

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of neurological disability across all ages, but the elderly are particularly vulnerable and have a worse prognosis than younger individuals. To advance the understanding of long-term pathogenesis induced by TBI in the elderly, aged mice (21 -- 24 months) were given a controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury to the sensorimotor cortex, and their brains were analyzed by MRI and histopathology at 1 and 2 months after CCI injury, a post-acute period. A T2 hypointensity was observed in the ipsilateral thalamus but not in the contralateral thalamus or in the thalamus of sham operated, control mice. The hypointensity was co-localized with increased histochemical staining of iron, a paramagnetic substance that causes a shortening of the T2 relaxation time. Since iron catalyzes reactions that lead to toxic free radicals, the deposition of iron in the thalamus raises the possibility that it promotes pathogenesis following TBI. Astrocyte gliosis and microgliosis were also observed in the ipsilateral thalamus in the post-acute period. The ipsilateral internal capsule displayed a trend for a T2 hypointensity, however, unlike the thalamus it did not have an increase of iron or GFAP staining, but it did have evidence of microgliosis. In summary, areas of T2 hypointensity were revealed in both the thalamus and internal capsule during the post-acute period following CCI injury, but the underlying pathology appeared to be distinct between these regions.},

  abstract = {The human brain develops rapidly during 32-45 postmenstrual weeks (PMW), a critical stage characterized by dramatic increases of metabolic demand. The increasing metabolic demand can be inferred through measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), which might be coupled to regional metabolism in preterm brains. Arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is one of the few viable approaches for imaging regional CBF of preterm brains, but must be optimized for the extremely slow blood velocity unique in preterm brains. In this study, we explored the spatiotemporal CBF distribution in newborns scanned at the age of 32-45PMW using a pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) protocol adapted to slow blood flow in neonates. A total of 89 neonates were recruited. PCASL MRI was acquired from 34 normal newborns and phase contrast (PC) images from 19 newborns. Diffusion tensor images (DTI) were acquired from all 89 neonates for measuring cortical fractional anisotropy (FA), which characterizes cortical microstructure. Reproducible CBF measurements were obtained with the adjusted pCASL sequence. Global CBF measurement based on PC MRI was found to double its value in the 3rd trimester. Regional CBF increases were heterogeneous across the brain with a significantly higher rate of CBF increase in the frontal lobe and a lower rate of CBF increase in the occipital lobe. A significant correlation was found between frontal cortical CBF and cortical FA measurements (p{$<$}0.01). Increasing CBF values observed in the frontal lobe corresponded to lower FA values, suggesting that dendritic arborization and synaptic formation might be associated with an elevated local CBF. These results offer a preliminary account of heterogeneous regional CBF increases in a vital early developmental period and may shed the light on underlying metabolic support for cortical microstructural changes during the developmental period of 32-45PMW. Preterm effects and limitations of pCASL techniques in newborns need to be carefully considered for interpretation these results.},

This equation is solved to give the expression for the generalized Stejskal-Tanner formula quantifying diffusive attenuation in complicated geometries. This makes it possible to calculate the components of higher-rank tensors without using the computationally-difficult spherical harmonic transform. General theoretical relations between the diffusion tensor (DT) components measured by traditional (rank-2) DT imaging (DTI) and 3D distribution of diffusivities, as measured by high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) methods, are derived. Also, the spherical tensor components from HARDI are related to the rank-2 DT. The relationships between higher- and lower-rank Cartesian DTs are also presented. The inadequacy of the traditional rank-2 tensor model is demonstrated with simulations, and the method is applied to excised rat brain data collected in a spin-echo HARDI experiment.},

This was accomplished with the use of an expression that generalizes the evaluation of the trace operator to tensors of arbitrary rank, and even to functions whose domains are the unit sphere. It is shown that the mean diffusivity is invariant to the selection of tensor rank for the model used. However, this rank invariance does not apply to the anisotropy measures. Therefore, a variance-based, general anisotropy measure is proposed. Also an information theoretical parametrization of anisotropy is introduced that is frequently more consistent with the meaning attributed to anisotropy. We accomplished this by associating anisotropy with the amount of orientational information present in the data, regardless of the imaging technique used. Using a simplified model of fibrous tissue, we simulated anisotropy values with varying orientational complexity and tensor models. Simulations suggested that a lower-rank tensor model may produce artificially low anisotropy values in voxels with complex structure. This was confirmed with a spin-echo experiment performed on an excised rat brain.},

Two approaches were adopted in both groups, when they were 10~years of age, using structural and functional brain magnetic resonance imaging data. The first was using a novel intrinsic ignition analysis to study the ability of the areas of the brain to propagate neural activity. The second was a whole-brain Hopf model, to define the level of stability, desynchronization, or criticality of the brain. EPT-born children exhibited fewer intrinsic ignition events than controls; nodes were related to less sophisticated aspects of cognitive control, and there was a different hierarchy pattern in the propagation of information and suboptimal synchronicity and criticality. The largest differences were found in brain nodes belonging to the rich-club architecture. These results provide important insights into the neural substrates underlying brain reorganization and neurodevelopmental impairments related to prematurity.},

These measures can be grouped into the categories of pathogenesis, impairment, and functional limitation. Neuroimaging techniques are the most predictive measures of pathogenesis of cerebral palsy in both the preterm and term infant. Measures of neurological impairment focusing on muscle tone, reflexes, and other features of the neurological examination are poorly predictive in the first months of life. Detection of functional limitations manifested by motor developmental delay is sensitive and specific for later cerebral palsy, but not until well into the second 6 months of life. Abnormal spontaneous general movements in the infant 16 to 20 weeks postterm and earlier reflect functional limitations in the first months of life and have been shown to predict later cerebral palsy.

  abstract = {Scale-free fluctuations are ubiquitous in behavioral performance and neuronal activity. In time scales from seconds to hundreds of seconds, psychophysical dynamics and the amplitude fluctuations of neuronal oscillations are governed by power-law-form long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs). In millisecond time scales, neuronal activity comprises cascade-like neuronal avalanches that exhibit power-law size and lifetime distributions. However, it remains unknown whether these neuronal scaling laws are correlated with those characterizing behavioral performance or whether neuronal LRTCs and avalanches are related. Here, we show that the neuronal scaling laws are strongly correlated both with each other and with behavioral scaling laws. We used source reconstructed magneto- and electroencephalographic recordings to characterize the dynamics of ongoing cortical activity. We found robust power-law scaling in neuronal LRTCs and avalanches in resting-state data and during the performance of audiovisual threshold stimulus detection tasks. The LRTC scaling exponents of the behavioral performance fluctuations were correlated with those of concurrent neuronal avalanches and LRTCs in anatomically identified brain systems. The behavioral exponents also were correlated with neuronal scaling laws derived from a resting-state condition and with a similar anatomical topography. Finally, despite the difference in time scales, the scaling exponents of neuronal LRTCs and avalanches were strongly correlated during both rest and task performance. Thus, long and short time-scale neuronal dynamics are related and functionally significant at the behavioral level. These data suggest that the temporal structures of human cognitive fluctuations and behavioral variability stem from the scaling laws of individual and intrinsic brain dynamics.},

  abstract = {In patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), the severity of clinical signs is not closely related to indices of structural brain damage provided by conventional magnetic resonance MR. Accordingly, patients with MS may show symptom recovery while progressively accumulating tissue damage. Changes in functional organization of the cerebral cortex have been reported in functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) studies that have compared the activation patterns during motor, visual, and cognitive tasks of patients with MS with those of healthy controls. fMRI studies on MS have provided the results that are difficult to compare and may be discrepant because of differences in the criteria used for patient selection, the activation paradigm, the experimental design, and the MR acquisition parameters. Nevertheless, they do provide a new, interesting tool that sheds light on how the brain changes its functional organization in response to MS. In patients with MS, functional brain reorganization mainly consists of an increase in the extent of activation of the brain areas used by healthy subjects, as well as the recruitment of additional brain areas. These findings have been interpreted as adaptive or compensatory mechanisms that allow normal performance despite neural damage or loss. However, brain functional activity may also change in response to clinical disability, though the precise role of brain functional changes in MS has yet to fully understand. Longitudinal studies designed to explore the effects of both rehabilitation and pharmacological agents on brain plasticity might shed light on this issue.},

  abstract = {Automatic segmentation of subcortical structures in human brain MR images is an important but difficult task due to poor and variable intensity contrast. Clear, well-defined intensity features are absent in many places along typical structure boundaries and so extra information is required to achieve successful segmentation. A method is proposed here that uses manually labelled image data to provide anatomical training information. It utilises the principles of the Active Shape and Appearance Models but places them within a Bayesian framework, allowing probabilistic relationships between shape and intensity to be fully exploited. The model is trained for 15 different subcortical structures using 336 manually-labelled T1-weighted MR images. Using the Bayesian approach, conditional probabilities can be calculated easily and efficiently, avoiding technical problems of ill-conditioned covariance matrices, even with weak priors, and eliminating the need for fitting extra empirical scaling parameters, as is required in standard Active Appearance Models. Furthermore, differences in boundary vertex locations provide a direct, purely local measure of geometric change in structure between groups that, unlike voxel-based morphometry, is not dependent on tissue classification methods or arbitrary smoothing. In this paper the fully-automated segmentation method is presented and assessed both quantitatively, using Leave-One-Out testing on the 336 training images, and qualitatively, using an independent clinical dataset involving Alzheimer's disease. Median Dice overlaps between 0.7 and 0.9 are obtained with this method, which is comparable or better than other automated methods. An implementation of this method, called FIRST, is currently distributed with the freely-available FSL package.},

Recent developments in high-field-strength magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have made it possible to visualize the STN in greater detail. However, the relationship of the MR-visualized STN to the anatomic, electrophysiological, or atlas-predicted STN remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the size of the STN visualized on 3-T MRI compared with anatomic measurements in cadaver studies and to compare the predictions of 3-T MRI and those of the Schaltenbrand-Wahren (SW) atlas for intraoperative STN microelectrode recordings. METHODS: We evaluated the STN by 3-T MRI and intraoperative microelectrode recordings in 20 Parkinson disease patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery. We compared our findings with anatomic cadaver studies and with the individually scaled SW atlas-based predictions for each patient. RESULTS: The dimensions of the 3-T MR-visualized STN were very similar to those of the largest anatomic study (MRI length, width, and height: 9.8 \textpm{} 1.6, 11.5 \textpm{} 1.6, and 3.7 \textpm{} 0.7 mm, respectively; n = 40; cadaver length, width, and height: 9.3 \textpm{} 0.7, 10.6 \textpm{} 0.9, and 3.1 \textpm{} 0.5 mm, respectively; n = 100). The amount of STN traversed during intraoperative microelectrode recordings was better correlated to the 3-T MR-visualized STN than the SW atlas-predicted STN (R = 0.38 vs R = -0.17). CONCLUSION: The STN as visualized on 3-T MRI corresponds well with cadaveric anatomic studies and intraoperative electrophysiology. STN visualization with 3-T MRI may be an improvement over SW atlas-based localization for STN deep brain stimulation surgery in Parkinson disease.},

  abstract = {Results from recent studies suggest that chronic cigarette smoking is associated with increased white matter volume in the brain as determined by in vivo neuroimaging. We used diffusion tensor imaging to examine the microstructural integrity of the white matter in 10 chronic smokers and 10 nonsmokers. All individuals were healthy, without histories of medical or psychiatric illness. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and trace were measured in the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum. FA provides a measure of directional versus nondirectional water diffusion, whereas trace provides a measure of nondirectional water diffusion. Lower FA and higher trace values are considered to reflect less brain integrity. Voxel-based morphometry was used to define volumes in each of these regions of the corpus callosum. Chronic smokers exhibited significantly higher FA in the body and whole corpus callosum and a strong trend for higher FA in the splenium compared with nonsmokers. FA did not differ between groups in the genu, and neither trace nor white matter volumes differed between groups in any of the regions of interest. When subdivided by Fagerstr\"om score (low vs. high), the low Fagerstr\"om group exhibited significantly higher FA in the body of the corpus callosum compared with the high Fagerstr\"om group and the nonsmokers. These results suggest that, among healthy adults, lower exposure to cigarette smoking is associated with increased microstructural integrity of the white matter compared with either no exposure or higher exposure. Additional studies are needed to further explore differences in white matter integrity between smokers and nonsmokers.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine chronic changes occurring at 6 months following partial optic nerve (ON) transection, assessing optic axons, myelin, and visual function. METHODS: Dorsal ON axons were transected, leaving ventral optic axons vulnerable to secondary degeneration. At 3 and 6 months following partial transection, toluidine-blue stained sections were used to assess dimensions of the ON injury site. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of ventral ON were used to quantify numbers, diameter, area, and myelin thickness of optic axons. Immunohistochemistry and fluoromyelin staining were used to assess semiquantitatively myelin protein, lipids in ventral ON, and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in midventral retina. Visuomotor function was assessed using optokinetic nystagmus. RESULTS: Following partial ON transection, optic axons and function remained disrupted at 6 months. Although ventral ON swelling observed at 3 months (P {$\leq$} 0.05) receded to normal by 6 months, ultrastructurally, myelinated axons remained swollen (P {$\geq$} 0.05), and myelin thickness increased (P {$\leq$} 0.05) due to loosening of lamellae and an increase in the number of intraperiodic lines. Axons with decompacted myelin persisted and were distinguished as having large axonal calibers and thicker myelin sheaths. Nevertheless, progressive loss of myelin lipid staining with fluoromyelin was seen at 6 months. Despite no further loss of ventral optic axons between 3 and 6 months (P {$\geq$} 0.05), visuomotor function progressively declined at 6 months following partial transection (P {$\leq$} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Continued decompaction of myelin, altered myelin structure, and swelling of myelinated axons are persistent features of the chronic phases of secondary degeneration and likely contribute to progressive loss of visual function.},

The level of these neurometabolites appears to differ in individual studies of people with pain compared to pain-free controls across different pain conditions. However, this has yet to be systematically investigated. AIMS: To establish whether GABA, glutamate, glutamine and Glx levels differ across pain conditions when compared to pain-free controls. METHODS: Five databases were searched. Studies were included if they investigated: 1) A pain condition compared to control. 2) Reported GABA, glutamate, glutamine or glutamate/glutamine level. 3) Used 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (Prospero Project ID CRD42018092170). Data extracted included neurometabolite level, pain diagnosis, and spectroscopy parameters. Meta-analyses were conducted to establish the difference in neurometabolite level between participants with pain and pain-free controls for different pain conditions. The MRS-Q was developed from existing clinical consensus to allow for the assessment of quality in the included studies. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies were included investigating combinations of migraine (n\,=\,11), musculoskeletal pain (n\,=\,8), chronic pain syndromes (n\,=\,9) and miscellaneous pain (n\,=\,10). Higher GABA levels were found in participants with migraine compared to controls (Hedge's G 0.499, 95\%CI: 0.2 to 0.798). In contrast, GABA levels in musculoskeletal pain conditions (Hedge's G -0.189, 95\%CI: 0.530 to 0.153) and chronic pain syndromes (Hedge's G 0.077, 95\%CI: 1.612 to 1.459) did not differ from controls. Results for other brain neurometabolites revealed significantly higher levels for glutamate in participants with migraine and Glx in chronic pain syndromes compared to controls. CONCLUSION: These results support the theory that underlying neurometabolite levels may be unique in different pain conditions and therefore representative of biomarkers for specific pain conditions.},

Our aim was to evaluate the relation between T2 values and two molecules associated with brain water homeostasis aquaporin 4 (AQP4) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG), as well as cellular populations in the hippocampal region of patients with TLE. METHODS: Hippocampal T2 imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were obtained from 42 drug-resistant patients with TLE and 20 healthy volunteers (radiologic controls, RCs). A similar protocol (ex~vivo) was applied to hippocampal sections from the same TLE cases and 14 autopsy control hippocampi (histologic and radiologic controls, HRCs), and each hippocampal subfield was evaluated. Hippocampal sections from TLE cases and HRC controls were submitted to immunohistochemistry for neurons (neuron nuclei [NeuN]), reactive astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), activated microglia (human leukocyte antigen-D-related [HLA-DR]), polarized AQP4, and CSPG. RESULTS: Patients with TLE had higher in~vivo and ex~vivo hippocampal T2 relaxation time. Hippocampi from epilepsy cases had lower neuron density, higher gliosis, decreased AQP4 polarization, and increased CSPG immunoreactive area. In vivo relaxation correlated with astrogliosis in the subiculum and extracellular CSPG in the hilus. Ex vivo T2 relaxation time correlated with astrogliosis in the hilus, CA4, and subiculum, and with microgliosis in CA1. The difference between in~vivo and ex~vivo relaxation ratio correlated with mean diffusivity and with the immunopositive area for CSPG in the hilus. SIGNIFICANCE: Our data indicate that astrogliosis, microgliosis, and CSPG expression correlate with the increased T2 relaxation time seen in the hippocampi of patients with TLE.},

From a side view, it was divided into seven equal levels, four (+Q1 to +Q4) above the head center of gravity and three below (-Q1 to -Q3). The initial helmet contact was located in these regions. Thirty-one impacts were reconstructed with helmeted Hybrid III dummies involving 25 concussions. Measurement of head translational and rotational acceleration was used to determine the average and +/-1 standard deviation in responses, with impacts reflected to the right side. RESULTS: From video, the majority (71\%) of impact is to the helmet shell primarily from a striking player's helmet, arm, or shoulder pad to the side (45-135 degrees) or from ground contact to the back (135-180 degrees). Most impacts were high on the helmet at +Q2 to +Q4. The remainder (29\%) were primarily from helmet contact on the facemask at an oblique frontal angle (0-45 degrees) and -Q3 to +Q1 height. From reconstructions, concussion occurred with the lowest peak head acceleration in facemask impacts at 78 +/- 18 g versus an average 107 to 117 g for impacts on other quadrants (t = 2.90, P {$<$} 0.005). There was a significantly higher head acceleration for concussed versus nonconcussed players (t = 2.85, P {$<$} 0.05). The vector of peak force was essentially horizontal for facemask impacts and downward at 12 to 27 degrees for impacts to the helmet side and back. Concussion in professional football involves four typical conditions, as follows: A, 0- to 45-degree quadrant, -Q3 to +Q3 level, peak force 49 +/- 18 degrees from front and horizontal; B, 45- to 90-degree quadrant, -Q2 to +Q3 level, peak force 73 +/- 12 degrees and horizontal; C, 90- to 135-degree quadrant, +Q1 to +Q4 level, peak force 97 +/- 9 degrees and 12 degrees downward; and D, 135- to 180-degree quadrant, +Q1 to +Q4 level, peak force 157 +/- 1 degrees and 27 degrees downward. Concussed players averaged 3.6 +/- 2.7 initial signs and symptoms. The most common were headaches, dizziness, immediate recall problems, and difficulty with information processing. CONCLUSION: The location, direction, and severity of helmet impacts causing concussion in the National Football League have been defined from analysis of game video and laboratory reconstruction. These conditions define the circumstances in which helmets need to reduce head injury risks in professional football.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Concussion in professional football was studied with respect to impact types and injury biomechanics. A combination of video surveillance and laboratory reconstruction of game impacts was used to evaluate concussion biomechanics. METHODS: Between 1996 and 2001, videotapes of concussions and significant head impacts were collected from National Football League games. There were clear views of the direction and location of the helmet impact for 182 cases. In 31 cases, the speed of impact could be determined with analysis of multiple videos. Those cases were reconstructed in laboratory tests using helmeted Hybrid III dummies and the same impact velocity, direction, and head kinematics as in the game. Translational and rotational accelerations were measured, to define concussion biomechanics. Several studies were performed to ensure the accuracy and reproducibility of the video analysis and laboratory methods used. RESULTS: Concussed players experienced head impacts of 9.3 +/- 1.9 m/s (20.8 +/- 4.2 miles/h). There was a rapid change in head velocity of 7.2 +/- 1.8 m/s (16.1 +/- 4.0 miles/h), which was significantly greater than that for uninjured struck players (5.0 +/- 1.1 m/s, 11.2 +/- 2.5 miles/h; t = 2.9, P {$<$} 0.005) or striking players (4.0 +/- 1.2 m/s, 8.9 +/- 2.7 miles/h; t = 7.6, P {$<$} 0.001). The peak head acceleration in concussion was 98 +/- 28 g with a 15-millisecond half-sine duration, which was statistically greater than the 60 +/- 24 g for uninjured struck players (t = 3.1, P {$<$} 0.005). Concussion was primarily related to translational acceleration resulting from impacts on the facemask or side, or falls on the back of the helmet. Concussion could be assessed with the severity index or head injury criterion (the conventional measures of head injury risk). Nominal tolerance levels for concussion were a severity index of 300 and a head injury criterion of 250. CONCLUSION: Concussion occurs with considerable head impact velocity and velocity changes in professional football. Current National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment standards primarily address impacts to the periphery and crown of the helmet, whereas players are experiencing injuries in impacts to the facemask, side, and back of the helmet. New tests are needed to assess the performance of helmets in reducing concussion risks involving high-velocity and long-duration injury biomechanics.},

  abstract = {In this work a model-free arterial spin labeling (ASL) quantification approach for measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial blood volume (aBV) is proposed. The method is based on the acquisition of a train of multiple images following the labeling scheme. Perfusion is obtained using deconvolution in a manner similar to that of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI. Local arterial input functions (AIFs) can be estimated by subtracting two perfusion-weighted images acquired with and without crusher gradients, respectively. Furthermore, by knowing the duration of the bolus of tagged arterial blood, one can estimate the aBV on a voxel-by-voxel basis. The maximum of the residue function obtained from the deconvolution of the tissue curve by the AIF is a measure of CBF after scaling by the locally estimated aBV. This method provides averaged gray matter (GM) perfusion values of 38 \textpm{} 2 ml/min/100 g and aBV of 0.93\% \textpm{} 0.06\%. The average CBF value is 10\% smaller than that obtained on the same data set using the standard general kinetic model (42 \textpm{} 2 ml/min/100 g). Monte Carlo simulations were performed to compare this new methodology with parametric fitting by the conventional model. Magn Reson Med, 2006. \copyright{} 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Thus, we investigated markers of oxidative stress in the central nervous system after mild and severe TBI in rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Adult male wistar rats (five animals per group) submitted to mild (mTBI group) or severe TBI (sTBI Group) were sacrificed 30 min, 3, 6, or 12 h after the injury to quantify markers of oxidative damage in different brain regions. Levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive species and protein carbonyl in the cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum of mTBI and sTBI groups were compared with the control group. RESULTS: After mTBI, levels of protein oxidation were increased in all analyzed structures in several different times after injury. The increase in TBARS levels was not so consistent in mTBI. In contrast, sTBI did not induce a sustainable increase in oxidative damage markers in all analyzed structures. CONCLUSIONS: Oxidative damage seemed to be inversely proportional to severity of traumatic brain injury.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The risk of cerebral palsy, the commonest physical disability of children in western Europe, is higher in infants of very low birthweight (VLBW)--those born weighing less than 1500 g--and those from multiple pregnancies than in infants of normal birthweight. An increasing proportion of infants from both of these groups survive into childhood. This paper describes changes in the frequency and distribution of cerebral palsy by sex and neurological subtype in infants with a birthweight below 1000 g and 1000-1499 g in the period 1980-96. METHODS: A group of 16 European centres, Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe, agreed a standard definition of cerebral palsy and inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data for children with cerebral palsy born in the years 1980-96 were pooled. The data were analysed to describe the distribution and prevalence of cerebral palsy in VLBW infants. Prevalence trends were expressed as both per 1000 livebirths and per 1000 neonatal survivors. FINDINGS: There were 1575 VLBW infants born with cerebral palsy; 414 (26\%) were of birthweight less than 1000 g and 317 (20\%) were from multiple pregnancies. 1426 (94\%) had spastic cerebral palsy, which was unilateral (hemiplegic) in 336 (24\%). The birth prevalence fell from 60.6 (99\%CI 37.8-91.4) per 1000 liveborn VLBW infants in 1980 to 39.5 (28.6-53.0) per 1000 VLBW infants in 1996. This decline was related to a reduction in the frequency of bilateral spastic cerebral palsy among infants of birthweight 1000-1499 g. The frequency of cerebral palsy was higher in male than female babies in the group of birthweight 1000-1499 g (61.0 [53.8-68..2] vs 49.5 [42.8-56.2] per 1000 livebirths; p=0.0025) but not in the group of birthweight below 1000 g. INTERPRETATION: These data from a large population base provide evidence that the prevalence of cerebral palsy in children of birthweight less than 1500 g has fallen, which has important implications for parents, health services, and society.},

  abstract = {Self-organized criticality (SOC) refers to the ability of complex systems to evolve toward a second-order phase transition at which interactions between system components lead to scale-invariant events that are beneficial for system performance. For the last two decades, considerable experimental evidence has accumulated that the mammalian cortex with its diversity in cell types, interconnectivity, and plasticity might exhibit SOC. Here, we review the experimental findings of isolated, layered cortex preparations to self-organize toward four dynamical motifs presently identified in the intact cortex               in vivo               : up-states, oscillations, neuronal avalanches, and coherence potentials. During up-states, the synchronization observed for nested theta/gamma oscillations embeds scale-invariant neuronal avalanches, which can be identified by robust power law scaling in avalanche sizes with a slope of -3/2 and a critical branching parameter of 1. This precise dynamical coordination, tracked in the negative transients of the local field potential (nLFP) and spiking activity of pyramidal neurons using two-photon imaging, emerges autonomously in superficial layers of organotypic cortex cultures and acute cortex slices, is homeostatically regulated, exhibits separation of time scales, and reveals unique size vs. quiet time dependencies. A subclass of avalanches, the coherence potentials, exhibits precise maintenance of the time course in propagated local synchrony. Avalanches emerge in superficial layers of the cortex under conditions of strong external drive. The balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I), as well as neuromodulators such as dopamine, establishes powerful control parameters for avalanche dynamics. This rich dynamical repertoire is not observed in dissociated cortex cultures, which lack the differentiation into cortical layers and exhibit a dynamical phenotype expected for a first-order phase transition. The precise interactions between up-states, nested oscillations, and avalanches in superficial layers of the cortex provide compelling evidence for SOC in the brain.},

Eight infants were victims of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, and two infants were accident cases. Gray and white matter samples from each brain were also dissected and analyzed. Galactolipids were only 12\% of the total lipids in white matter from brains of infants that were 24 days-of-age, a time when myelination was just starting in the subcortical areas. At 175 and 350 days of age, myelination was well underway and galactolipids measured 22\% of the total lipids. Total phospholipids decreased (65\% to 54\%) in white matter during development, with the decrease mostly in phosphatidylcholine (23\% to 15\%). Even though there was little white matter present at early ages, myelin could be isolated. Surprisingly, the lipid composition of myelin from the 24-day-infant brain was similar to that from adult brain. Galactolipids were 22\% of the total lipids, cholesterol, 23\%, and phospholipids, 52\%. These results suggest that only subtle remodeling of myelin occurs in humans once myelination commences. All four major gangliosides were present in myelin during this first year of development. Interestingly, the yield of myelin from the 350-day-old infant subcortical white matter was similar to that from an adult. Thus major tracts in this area may have acquired most of the myelin by one year-after-birth. Since the control samples blend quite well into the developmental pattern obtained, it is believed there are no abnormalities in myelin lipids from SIDS infants.},

  abstract = {Criticality has gained widespread interest in neuroscience as an attractive framework for understanding the character and functional implications of variability in brain activity. The metastability of critical systems maximizes their dynamic range, storage capacity, and computational power. Power-law scaling---a hallmark of criticality---has been observed on different levels, e.g., in the distribution of neuronal avalanches in vitro and in vivo, but also in the decay of temporal correlations in behavioral performance and ongoing oscillations in humans. An unresolved issue is whether power-law scaling on different organizational levels in the brain---and possibly in other hierarchically organized systems---can be related. Here, we show that critical-state dynamics of avalanches and oscillations jointly emerge in a neuronal network model when excitation and inhibition is balanced. The oscillatory activity of the model was qualitatively similar to what is typically observed in recordings of human resting-state MEG. We propose that homeostatic plasticity mechanisms tune this balance in healthy brain networks, and that it is essential for critical behavior on multiple levels of neuronal organization with ensuing functional benefits. Based on our network model, we introduce a concept of multi-level criticality in which power-law scaling can emerge on multiple time scales in oscillating networks.},

  abstract = {Summary   Previous studies suggest that the brain operates at a critical point in which phases of order and disorder coexist, producing emergent patterned dynamics at all scales and optimizing several brain functions. Here, we combined light-sheet microscopy with GCaMP zebrafish larvae to study whole-brain dynamics invivo at near single-cell resolution. We show that spontaneous activity propagates in the brain's three-dimensional space, generating scale-invariant neuronal avalanches with time courses and recurrence times that exhibit statistical self-similarity at different magnitude, temporal, and frequency scales. This suggests that the nervous system operates close to a non-equilibrium phase transition, where a large repertoire of spatial, temporal, and interactive modes can be supported. Finally, we show that gap junctions contribute to the maintenance of criticality and that, during interactions with the environment (sensory inputs and self-generated behaviors), the system is transiently displaced to a more ordered regime, conceivably to limit the potential sensory representations and motor outcomes.},

Drawing upon literature gleaned from the experimental and clinical setting, this review attempts to emphasize that, other than the most destructive insults, traumatic brain injury does not typically cause direct mechanical disruption of the axon. Rather, this review documents that with traumatic injury focal, subtle axonal change occurs, and that over time, such change leads to impaired axoplasmic transport, continued axonal swelling, and ultimate disconnection. The initial intra-axonal events that trigger the above described sequence of reactive axonal change are considered with focus on the possibility of either traumatically altered axolemmal permeability, direct cytoskeletal damage/perturbation, or more overt metabolic/functional disturbances. Not only does this review focus on the sequence of traumatically induced axonal change, but also, it considers its attendant consequences in terms of Wallerian degeneration and subsequent deafferentation. The concept that traumatically induced diffuse axonal injury leads to diffuse deafferentation is emphasized together with its pathobiological implications for morbidity and recovery. The potential for either adaptive or maladaptive neuroplasticity subsequent to such diffuse deafferentation is considered in the context of mild, moderate and severe traumatic brain injury.},

New insight is provided on the pathobiology of traumatically induced cell body injury and diffuse axonal damage. The consequences of axonal damage in terms of subsequent deafferentation and any potential retrograde cell death and atrophy are addressed. The regional and global metabolic sequelae are also considered. This detailed presentation of the neuropathological consequences of traumatic brain injury is used to set the stage for better appreciating the neurological recovery occurring after traumatic injury. Although the pathological and clinical effects of focal and diffuse damage are usually intermingled, the different clinical manifestations of recovery patterns associated with focal versus diffuse injuries are presented. The recognizable patterns of recovery, involving unconsciousness, posttraumatic confusion/amnesia, and postconfusional restoration, that typically occur across the full spectrum of diffuse injury are described, recognizing that the patient's long-term recovery may involve more idiosyncratic combinations of dysfunction. The review highlights the relationship of focal lesions to localizing syndromes that may be embedded in the evolving natural history of diffuse pathology. It is noted that injuries with primarily focal pathology do not necessarily follow a comparable pattern of recovery with distinct phases. Potential linkages of these recovery patterns to the known neuropathological sequelae of injury and various reparative mechanisms are considered and it is proposed that potential biological markers and newer imaging technologies will better define these linkages.},

Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to perform regional measurements in 50 subjects with varying degrees of cerebral ischemia but no evidence of infarction. There were 24 normal subjects, 24 subjects with arteriographic evidence of vascular disease of the carotid system, and two subjects with reversible ischemic neurological deficits due to cerebral vasospasm. Minimum values found in the 48 subjects with normal neurological function were 19 ml/100 g-min for regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and 1.3 ml/100 g-min for regional cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO               2               ). Minimum values for all 50 subjects with viable cerebral tissue were 15 ml/100 g-min for rCBF and 1.3 ml/100 g-min for rCMRO               2               . Comparison of these measurements with values from 20 areas of established cerebral infarction in 10 subjects demonstrated that 80\% (16/20) of infarcted regions had rCMRO               2               values below the lower normal limit of 1.3 ml/100g-min.

These data indicate that quantitative regional measurements of rCMRO               2               with PET accurately distinguish viable from nonviable cerebral tissue and may be useful in the prospective identification of patients with reversible ischemia.},

These changes cause systematic but spurious correlation structures throughout the brain. Specifically, many long-distance correlations are decreased by subject motion, whereas many short-distance correlations are increased. These changes in rs-fcMRI correlations do not arise from, nor are they adequately countered by, some common functional connectivity processing steps. Two indices of data quality are proposed, and a simple method to reduce motion-related effects in rs-fcMRI analyses is demonstrated that should be flexibly implementable across a variety of software platforms. We demonstrate how application of this technique impacts our own data, modifying previous conclusions about brain development. These results suggest the need for greater care in dealing with subject motion, and the need to critically revisit previous rs-fcMRI work that may not have adequately controlled for effects of transient subject movements.},

In this study, we validated the use of a fast multi echo T(2) relaxation sequence for myelin water imaging. Using a multiple combined gradient and spin echo (GRASE) technique, we attain whole cerebrum myelin water images in under 15 minutes. Region of interest analysis indicates that this fast GRASE imaging sequence produces results which are in good agreement with pure spin echo measurements (R(2)=0.95, p{$<$}0.0001). This drastic improvement in speed and brain coverage compared to current spin echo standards will allow increased inclusion of myelin water imaging in neurological research protocols and opens up the possibility of applications in a clinical setting.},

In contrast, an attractor state, called self-organized critical (SOC), was proposed to govern brain dynamics because it allows for optimal information coding. But is the human brain SOC for each vigilance state despite the variations in neuronal dynamics? We characterized neuronal avalanches -- spatiotemporal waves of enhanced activity - from dense intracranial depth recordings in humans. We showed that avalanche distributions closely follow a power law -- the hallmark feature of SOC - for each vigilance state. However, avalanches clearly differ with vigilance states: slow wave sleep (SWS) shows large avalanches, wakefulness intermediate, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep small ones. Our SOC model, together with the data, suggested first that the differences are mediated by global but tiny changes in synaptic strength, and second, that the changes with vigilance states reflect small deviations from criticality to the subcritical regime, implying that the human brain does not operate at criticality proper but close to SOC. Independent of criticality, the analysis confirms that SWS shows increased correlations between cortical areas, and reveals that REM sleep shows more fragmented cortical dynamics.},

  abstract = {In self-organized critical (SOC) systems avalanche size distributions follow power-laws. Power-laws have also been observed for neural activity, and so it has been proposed that SOC underlies brain organization as well. Surprisingly, for spiking activity in vivo, evidence for SOC is still lacking. Therefore we analyzed highly parallel spike recordings from awake rats and monkeys, anaesthetized cats, and also local field potentials from humans. We compared these to spiking activity from two established critical models: the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld model, and a stochastic branching model. We found fundamental differences between the neural and the model activity. These differences could be overcome for both models through a combination of three modifications: (1) subsampling, (2) increasing the input to the model (this way eliminating the separation of time scales, which is fundamental to SOC and its avalanche definition), and (3) making the model slightly sub-critical. The match between the neural activity and the modified models held not only for the classical avalanche size distributions and estimated branching parameters, but also for two novel measures (mean avalanche size, and frequency of single spikes), and for the dependence of all these measures on the temporal bin size. Our results suggest that neural activity in vivo shows a melange of avalanches, and not temporally separated ones, and that their global activity propagation can be approximated by the principle that one spike on average triggers a little less than one spike in the next step. This implies that neural activity does not reflect a SOC state but a slightly sub-critical regime without a separation of time scales. Potential advantages of this regime may be faster information processing, and a safety margin from super-criticality, which has been linked to epilepsy.},

For comparison, 12 infants without perinatal asphyxia were also investigated. Global cerebral blood flow (CBF infinity) was determined by xenon 133 clearance two or three times within approximately 2 hours. During the cerebral blood flow measurement, the amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram and visual-evoked potential were recorded. Changes in arterial carbon dioxide pressure followed adjustments of the ventilator settings, whereas MABP fluctuated spontaneously. Arterial oxygen pressure and blood glucose concentration were in the normal range. Five of the asphyxiated infants had isoelectric electroencephalograms and died subsequently with severe brain damage. They had a high CBF infinity (mean 30.6 ml/100 gm/min) and abolished carbon dioxide and MABP reactivity. Lower CBF infinity (mean 14.7 ml/100 gm/min) and abolished MABP reactivity were found in another five asphyxiated infants with burst-suppression electroencephalograms in whom computed tomographic or clinical signs of brain lesions developed. The carbon dioxide reactivity was preserved in these infants. In the remaining nine asphyxiated infants without signs of central nervous system abnormality, carbon dioxide and MABP reactivity were preserved, as was also the case in the control group. We conclude that abolished autoregulation is associated with cerebral damage in asphyxiated infants and that the combination of isoelectric electroencephalograms and cerebral hyperperfusion is an early indicator of very severe brain damage.},

The aim of this study was to apply new MRI techniques to quantify cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), global cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen saturation fractions in venous blood (Yv) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in neonates with PWML, for better understanding of the pathophysiology of PWML. Fifty-one newborns were recruited continuously, including 23 neonatal patients with PWML and 28 normal control neonates. Phase-contrast (PC) MRI and T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST) MRI were performed for the measurement of CBF and Yv. OEF and CMRO2 were calculated from the CBF and Yv values. The total maturation score (TMS) was assessed for each neonate on standard T1, 2-weighted images to evaluate cerebral maturation. The CMRO2, CBF, Yv, and OEF values were compared between groups, and their associations with age and TMS were evaluated. Significant differences between PWML group and control group were found in CMRO2 (P = 0.020), CBF (P = 0.027), Yv (P = 0.012), OEF (P = 0.018). After age/maturation is accounted for, Yv and OEF showed significant dependence on the groups (P {$<$} 0.05). Newborns with PWML had lower OEF and higher Yv. CMRO2, CBF and brain volume were correlated with age (P {$<$} 0.001) and TMS (P {$<$} 0.05). It is feasible to use non-invasive MRI methods to measure cerebral oxygen supply and consumption in neonates with PWML. Newborns with PWML have lower oxygen consumption. Yv and OEF may be helpful for the diagnosis of PWML. The positive correlation between CBF and TMS, and between CMRO2 and TMS suggested that as myelination progresses, the blood supply and oxygen metabolism in the brain increase to meet the escalating energy demand.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This article provides recommendations for implementing QSM for clinical brain research. It is a consensus of the International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, Electro-Magnetic Tissue Properties Study Group. While QSM technical development continues to advance rapidly, the current QSM methods have been demonstrated to be repeatable and reproducible for generating quantitative tissue magnetic susceptibility maps in the brain. However, the many QSM approaches available have generated a need in the neuroimaging community for guidelines on implementation. This article outlines considerations and implementation recommendations for QSM data acquisition, processing, analysis, and publication. We recommend that data be acquired using a monopolar 3D multi-echo gradient echo (GRE) sequence and that phase images be saved and exported in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format and unwrapped using an exact unwrapping approach. Multi-echo images should be combined before background field removal, and a brain mask created using a brain extraction tool with the incorporation of phase-quality-based masking. Background fields within the brain mask should be removed using a technique based on SHARP or PDF, and the optimization approach to dipole inversion should be employed with a sparsity-based regularization. Susceptibility values should be measured relative to a specified reference, including the common reference region of the whole brain as a region of interest in the analysis. The minimum acquisition and processing details required when reporting QSM results are also provided. These recommendations should facilitate clinical QSM research and promote harmonized data acquisition, analysis, and reporting.},

Design               Systematic review and network meta-analysis using the Bayesian random-effects approach. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched.                                         Interventions               High flow nasal cannula (HFNC), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel CPAP (BiPAP), noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).                                         Main Outcome Measures               Requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (MV), any treatment failure.                                         Results               A total of 35 studies including 4078 neonates were included. NIPPV was more effective in decreasing the requirement of MV than CPAP (risk ratios [95\% credible interval]: 0.60 [0.44, 0.77]) and HFNC [0.66 (0.43, 0.97)]. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) for NIPPV, BiPAP, HFNC, and CPAP were 0.95, 0.59, 0.32, and 0.13. For the outcome of treatment failure, both NIPPV and BiPAP were more efficacious compared to CPAP and HFNC (0.56 [0.44, 0.71] \textbraceleft NIPPV vs CPAP\textbraceright, 0.69 [0.51, 0.93] \textbraceleft BiPAP vs CPAP\textbraceright, 0.42 [0.30, 0.63] \textbraceleft NIPPV vs HFNC\textbraceright, 0.53 [0.35, 0.81] \textbraceleft BiPAP vs HFNC\textbraceright ). The SUCRA for NIPPV, BiPAP, CPAP, and HFNC were 0.96, 0.70, 0.32, and 0.01. NIPPV was associated with a reduced risk of air leak compared to BiPAP and CPAP (0.36 [0.16, 0.73]; 0.54 [0.30, 0.87], respectively). NIPPV resulted in lesser incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or mortality when compared to CPAP (0.74 [0.52, 0.98]). Nasal injury was lesser with HFNC compared to CPAP (0.15 [0.01, 0.60]).                                         Conclusions               Most effective primary mode of NRS in preterm neonates with RDS was NIPPV.},

  abstract = {Background and purpose: Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy causes hypoxic brain injury. Due to differences in brain maturity at time of insult, severity of hypotension and duration of insult, there are four distinct patterns of brain injury. Magnetic resonance imaging is the most sensitive modality for evaluating these patterns of brain injury. Additional role of Diffusion weighted imaging and ADC values can be useful in the evaluation of such cases. We conducted this study to analyse the usefulness of ADC values in the brain tissue affected by hypoxic-ischemic injury. Materials and Methods: We conducted a prospective study of all the patients referred to our department for magnetic resonance scanning of brain with history of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and clinical features cerebral palsy. 23 Cases with imaging manifestations of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy were included in the study. We studied distribution patterns of HIE in our cases and calculated the ADC values of involved as well as normal grey and white matter. Further, sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios for each dichotomized diffusion and ADC values were obtained Wilson Score method. Results: The most common distribution pattern in our study was involvement of peri-rolandic area (15 cases, 65\%). ADC values were significantly (p\,{$<$}\,0.005) increased in abnormal white matter. No significant changes (p\,=\,0.8) were seen in ADC values of normal and abnormal grey matter. Conclusions: Due to significant increase in ADC values of affected white matter, ADC value can be used as a marker to detect chronic sequel of hypoxic ischaemic brain injury. Another observation was the perirolandic brain tissue being most common area of involvement in the cases with cerebral palsy.},

Results                                The ELGANs with later WM abnormalities exhibited lower SpO                 2                 and pO                 2                 levels, and higher FiO                 2                 need during the first 3 days than those with normal WM. They also had higher pCO                 2                 values. The infants with abnormal MEG-SII showed opposite findings, i.e., displayed higher SpO                 2                 and pO                 2                 levels and lower FiO                 2                 need, than those with better outcomes. Severe WM changes and abnormal MEG-SII were correlated with adverse neurodevelopment.                                                        Conclusions                                Low oxygen levels and high FiO                 2                 need during the NICU care associate with WM abnormalities, whereas higher oxygen levels correlate with abnormal MEG-SII. The results may indicate certain brain structures being more vulnerable to hypoxia and others to hyperoxia, thus emphasizing the role of strict saturation targets.                                                        Impact                                                                        This study indicates that both abnormally low and high oxygen levels during early NICU care are harmful for later neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm neonates.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Experimental studies have suggested a role for iron accumulation in the pathology of TBI. Magnetic field correlation MR imaging is sensitive to the presence of non-heme iron. The aims of this study are to 1) assess the presence, if any, and the extent of iron deposition in the deep gray matter and regional white matter of patients with mTBI by using MFC MR imaging; and 2) investigate the association of regional brain iron deposition with cognitive and behavioral performance of patients with mTBI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 28 patients with mTBI. Eighteen healthy subjects served as controls. The subjects were administered the Stroop color word test, the Verbal Fluency Task, and the Post-Concussion Symptoms Scale. The MR imaging protocol (on a 3T imager) consisted of conventional brain imaging and MFC sequences. After the calculation of parametric maps, MFC was measured by using a region of interest approach. MFC values across groups were compared by using analysis of covariance, and the relationship of MFC values and neuropsychological tests were evaluated by using Spearman correlations. RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with mTBI demonstrated significant higher MFC values in the globus pallidus (P = .002) and in the thalamus (P = .036). In patients with mTBI, Stroop test scores were associated with the MFC value in frontal white matter (r = -0.38, P = .043). CONCLUSIONS: MFC values were significantly elevated in the thalamus and globus pallidus of patients with mTBI, suggesting increased accumulation of iron. This supports the hypothesis that deep gray matter is a site of injury in mTBI and suggests a possible role for iron accumulation in the pathophysiological events after mTBI.},

OBJECTIVE               To systematically review and meta-analyze neurodevelopmental outcomes among preterm infants after intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and white matter injury (WMI).                                         DATA SOURCES               Published and grey literature were searched across 10 databases between 2000 and 2021.                                         STUDY SELECTION               Observational studies reporting 3-year neurodevelopmental outcomes for preterm infants with IVH or WMI compared with preterm infants without injury.                                         DATA EXTRACTION               Study characteristics, population characteristics, and outcome data were extracted.                                         RESULTS               Thirty eight studies were included. There was an increased adjusted risk of moderate-severe neurodevelopmental impairment after IVH grade 1 to 2 (adjusted odds ratio 1.35 [95\% confidence interval 1.05--1.75]) and IVH grade 3 to 4 (adjusted odds ratio 4.26 [3.25--5.59]). Children with IVH grade 1 to 2 had higher risks of cerebral palsy (odds ratio [OR] 1.76 [1.39--2.24]), cognitive (OR 1.79 [1.09--2.95]), hearing (OR 1.83 [1.03--3.24]), and visual impairment (OR 1.77 [1.08--2.9]). Children with IVH grade 3 to 4 had markedly higher risks of~cerebral palsy (OR 4.98 [4.13--6.00]), motor (OR 2.7 [1.52--4.8]), cognitive (OR 2.3 [1.67--3.15]), hearing (OR 2.44 [1.42--4.2]), and visual impairment (OR 5.42 [2.77--10.58]). Children with WMI had much higher risks of cerebral palsy (OR 14.91 [7.3--30.46]), motor (OR 5.3 [3--9.36]), and cognitive impairment (OR 3.48 [2.18--5.53]).                                         LIMITATIONS               Heterogeneity of outcome data.                                         CONCLUSIONS               Mild IVH, severe IVH, and WMI are associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Utilization of core outcome sets and availability of open-access study data would improve our understanding of the nuances of these outcomes.},

  abstract = {Traumatic axonal injury (TAI), a common feature of traumatic brain injury, is associated with postinjury morbidity and mortality. However, TAI is not uniformly expressed in all axonal populations, with fiber caliber and anatomical location influencing specific TAI pathology. To study differential axonal vulnerability to brain injury, axonal excitability and integrity were assessed in the corpus callosum following fluid percussion injury in the rat. In brain slice electrophysiological recordings, compound action potentials (CAPs) were evoked in the corpus callosum, and injury effects were quantified separately for CAP waveform components generated by myelinated axons (N1 wave) and by unmyelinated axons (N2 wave). Ultrastructural analyses were also conducted of TAI-induced morphological changes in these axonal populations. The two populations of axons differed in response to brain injury, and in their functional recovery, during the first week postinjury. Amplitudes of N1 and N2 were significantly depressed at 3 h, 1 day, and 3 days survival. N1 amplitudes exhibited a recovery to control levels by 7 days postinjury. In contrast, N2 amplitudes were persistently suppressed through 7 days postinjury. Strength-duration properties of evoked CAPs further differentiated the effects of injury in these axonal populations, with N2 exhibiting an elevated strength-duration time constant postinjury. Ultrastructural observations revealed degeneration of myelinated axons consistent with diffuse injury sequelae, as well as previously undocumented pathology within the unmyelinated fiber population. Collectively, these findings demonstrate differential vulnerabilities of axons to brain injury and suggest that damage to unmyelinated fibers may play a significant role in morbidity associated with brain injury.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To review the fundamental principles of susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and to discuss recent clinical developments. METHODS: SWI is a magnetic resonance imaging method that takes advantage of magnitude signal loss and phase information to reveal anatomic and physiologic information about tissue and venous vasculature. The method enhances image contrast qualitatively, relying on phase shifts due to differences in magnetic susceptibility between tissues. QSM, extending SWI in an elegant way, is a new sophisticated postprocessing technique that numerically solves the inverse source-effect problem to derive local tissue magnetic susceptibility (source) from the measured magnetic field distribution (effect) as it is reflected in the phase images of gradient-echo sequences. RESULTS: SWI has meanwhile been established in numerous clinical as well as basic biomedical applications due to its ability to highlight tissue structures and compounds that are difficult to detect by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including iron, calcifications, small veins, blood, and bones. The field of QSM has also progressed rapidly, both in terms of optimizing the post-processing strategies and algorithms as well as in gaining ground for new clinical applications that take advantage of its quantitative nature and improved specificity to identify the magnetic signature of lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Though magnetic susceptibility may be a major nuisance producing image artifacts in MRI, recent work has transformed it into a useful source of image contrast. Both SWI and QSM are gaining increasing acceptance in clinical practice. In particular, QSM provides new insights into tissue composition and organization due to its more direct relation to the actual physical tissue magnetic properties.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Measurement of cerebral venous oxyhemoglobin saturation (ScvO2) is considered a gold standard in assessing the adequacy of tissue oxygen delivery (DO2) after the stage 1 palliation (S1P), with SvO2~{$<$}30\% often representing severely compromised DO2. Regional oxygenation index (rSO2) based on near-infrared resonance spectroscopy (NIRS) frequently is used to screen for compromised DO2, although its sensitivity to detect severe abnormalities in SvO2 is uncertain. METHODS: ScvO2 was measured by co-oximetry from the internal jugular vein as clinically indicated in 73 neonates after S1P. These values were compared with cerebral rSO2 (FORE-SIGHT; CASMED) via mixed effects model linear regression, Bland-Altman analysis, and sensitivity analysis. Because NIRS devices measure a composite of arterial and venous blood, we calculated an rSO2-based ScvO2 designed to remove arterial contamination from the rSO2 signal: rSO2-based ScvO2~=~(rSO2 - arterial oxygen saturation~\texttimes ~0.3)/0.7. RESULTS: Among 520 time-matched pairs of ScvO2 and cerebral rSO2, the slope of the relationship between rSO2 and ScvO2 (after we adjusted for effects of hemoglobin) was 0.37~\textpm ~0.04 with only modest correlation (r2~=~0.39), and mean bias of +8.26. When ScvO2 was {$<$}30\%, cerebral rSO2 was {$<$}30 in less than 1\%, {$<$}40 less than 1\%, and {$<$}50 in 45.7\% of data points; specificity of rSO2 in the same range is {$>$}99\%. Correction of rSO2 for arterial contamination significantly decreased mean bias (+3.03) and improved the sensitivity of rSO2 to detect ScvO2~{$<$}30 to 6.5\% for rSO2~{$<$}30, 29\% for rSO2~{$<$}40, and 77.4\% for rSO2~{$<$}50. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral rSO2 in isolation should not be used to detect low ScvO2, because its sensitivity is low, although correction of rSO2 for arterial contamination may improve sensitivity. Cerebral rSO2 of 50 or greater should not be considered reassuring, though values below 30 are specific for low ScvO2.},

  abstract = {The human brain is fragile in the face of oxygen deprivation. Even a brief interruption of metabolic supply at birth challenges an otherwise healthy neonatal cortex, leading to a cascade of homeostatic responses. During recovery from hypoxia, cortical activity exhibits a period of highly irregular electrical fluctuations known as burst suppression. Here we show that these bursts have fractal properties, with power-law scaling of burst sizes across a remarkable 5 orders of magnitude and a scale-free relationship between burst sizes and durations. Although burst waveforms vary greatly, their average shape converges to a simple form that is asymmetric at long time scales. Using a simple computational model, we argue that this asymmetry reflects activity-dependent changes in the excitatory--inhibitory balance of cortical neurons. Bursts become more symmetric following the resumption of normal activity, with a corresponding reorganization of burst scaling relationships. These findings place burst suppression in the broad class of scale-free physical processes termed crackling noise and suggest that the resumption of healthy activity reflects a fundamental reorganization in the relationship between neuronal activity and its underlying metabolic constraints.},

  abstract = {The brain depends almost entirely on oxidative metabolism to meet its significant energy requirements. As such, the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO               2               ) represents a key measure of brain function. Quantification of CMRO               2               has helped elucidate brain functional physiology and holds potential as a clinical tool for evaluating neurological disorders including stroke, brain tumors, Alzheimer's disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. In recent years, a variety of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based CMRO               2               quantification methods have emerged. Unlike positron emission tomography -- the current ``gold standard'' for measurement and mapping of CMRO               2               -- MRI is non-invasive, relatively inexpensive, and ubiquitously available in modern medical centers. All MRI-based CMRO               2               methods are based on modeling the effect of paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin on the magnetic resonance signal. The various methods can be classified in terms of the MRI contrast mechanism used to quantify CMRO               2               : T               2               *, T               2               {$\prime$}, T               2               , or magnetic susceptibility. This review article provides an overview of MRI-based CMRO               2               quantification techniques. After a brief historical discussion motivating the need for improved CMRO               2               methodology, current state-of-the-art MRI-based methods are critically appraised in terms of their respective tradeoffs between spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and robustness, all of critical importance given the spatially heterogeneous and temporally dynamic nature of brain energy requirements.},

Because this disease primarily affects neurons, tissue is not available during active disease. We used the olfactory system as a model to investigate abnormalities in neuronal development in RTT, because olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) are replaced throughout life by ongoing postnatal neurogenesis. Thus, even in the adult, the olfactory epithelium contains neurons at various developmental stages. We obtained biopsies of nasal epithelium containing ORNs from RTT patients and age-matched controls to study the status of the neuronal population using antibodies to stage-specific developmental markers. There were no postprocedure complications. Compared with age-matched controls, there were far fewer mature ORNs, as defined by olfactory marker protein expression, and significantly greater numbers of immature neuron-specific tubulin-positive ORNs present. In RTT biopsies, olfactory marker protein-positive neurons displayed abnormal structure. These results suggest that dysfunction of MeCP2 results in decreased survival of mature ORNs with a compensatory increase in neurogenesis, or a failure of immature neurons to mature. Our study indicates that olfactory biopsies provide a method to study neuronal developmental diseases in adults and children.},

  abstract = {Cytotoxic edema (CytE) is an increment in total brain water produced when the excess water swells cells rather than expanding the extracellular space. CytE contributes to brain swelling with a resultant increase of intracranial pressure (ICP). However, questions remain concerning the magnitude of the contribution made by CytE to raised ICP and the ability of CytE by itself to produce lethal levels of ICP that result in brainstem herniation. These questions exist because there are pitfalls in estimating the magnitude of CytE and hence its contribution to ICP using either electron microscopy or in vivo surrogates for CytE such as impedance measurements or the apparent diffusion coefficient. Correlation of these measures has been made during CytE. However, the literature provides reasons to question whether any of these surrogates for CytE can give accurate quantitative measures of CytE. At present, there is little evidence to indicate that CytE can, by itself, raise ICP to lethal levels. However, because CytE can raise ICP, it is of interest to develop treatments to prevent or reduce CytE even though currently available data do not yet provide an established mechanistic basis upon which to base such therapy.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Complexity in the brain has been well-documented at both neuronal and hemodynamic scales, with increasing evidence supporting its use in sensitively differentiating between mental states and disorders. However, application of complexity measures to fMRI time-series, which are short, sparse, and have low signal/noise, requires careful modality-specific optimization. Methods: Here we use both simulated and real data to address two fundamental issues: choice of algorithm and degree/ type of signal processing. Methods were evaluated with regard to resilience to acquisition artifacts common to fMRI as well as detection sensitivity. Detection sensitivity was quantified in terms of grey-white matter contrast and overlap with activation. We additionally investigated the variation of complexity with activation and emotional content, optimal task length, and the degree to which results scaled with scanner using the same paradigm with two 3T magnets made by different manufacturers. Methods for evaluating complexity were: power spectrum, structure function, wavelet decomposition, second derivative, rescaled range, Higuchi's estimate of fractal dimension, aggregated variance, and detrended fluctuation analysis. To permit direct comparison across methods, all results were normalized to Hurst exponents. Results: Power-spectrum, Higuchi's fractal dimension, and generalized Hurst exponent based estimates were most successful by all criteria; the poorest-performing measures were wavelet, detrended fluctuation analysis, aggregated variance, and rescaled range. Conclusions: Functional MRI data have artifacts that interact with complexity calculations in nontrivially distinct ways compared to other physiological data (such as EKG, EEG) for which these measures are typically used. Our results clearly demonstrate that decisions regarding choice of algorithm, signal processing, time-series length, and scanner have a significant impact on the reliability and sensitivity of complexity estimates.},

  abstract = {Self-organized criticality refers to the spontaneous emergence of self-similar dynamics in complex systems poised between order and randomness. The presence of self-organized critical dynamics in the brain is theoretically appealing and is supported by recent neurophysiological studies. Despite this, the neurobiological determinants of these dynamics have not been previously sought. Here, we systematically examined the influence of such determinants in hierarchically modular networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity and axonal conduction delays. We characterized emergent dynamics in our networks by distributions of active neuronal ensemble modules (neuronal avalanches) and rigorously assessed these distributions for power-law scaling. We found that spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity enabled a rapid phase transition from random subcritical dynamics to ordered supercritical dynamics. Importantly, modular connectivity and low wiring cost broadened this transition, and enabled a regime indicative of self-organized criticality. The regime only occurred when modular connectivity, low wiring cost and synaptic plasticity were simultaneously present, and the regime was most evident when between-module connection density scaled as a power-law. The regime was robust to variations in other neurobiologically relevant parameters and favored systems with low external drive and strong internal interactions. Increases in system size and connectivity facilitated internal interactions, permitting reductions in external drive and facilitating convergence of postsynaptic-response magnitude and synaptic-plasticity learning rate parameter values towards neurobiologically realistic levels. We hence infer a novel association between self-organized critical neuronal dynamics and several neurobiologically realistic features of structural connectivity. The central role of these features in our model may reflect their importance for neuronal information processing.},

  abstract = {Estimates of the apparent transverse relaxation rate (R2*) can be used to quantify important properties of biological tissue. Surprisingly, the mechanism of R2* dependence on tissue orientation is not well understood. The primary goal of this paper was to characterize orientation dependence of R2* in gray and white matter and relate it to independent measurements of two other susceptibility based parameters: the local Larmor frequency shift (fL) and quantitative volume magnetic susceptibility ({$\Delta\chi$}). Through this comparative analysis we calculated scaling relations quantifying R2' (reversible contribution to the transverse relaxation rate from local field inhomogeneities) in a voxel given measurements of the local Larmor frequency shift. R2' is a measure of both perturber geometry and density and is related to tissue microstructure. Additionally, two methods (the Generalized Lorentzian model and iterative dipole inversion) for calculating {$\Delta\chi$} were compared in gray and white matter. The value of {$\Delta\chi$} derived from fitting the Generalized Lorentzian model was then connected to the observed R2* orientation dependence using image-registered optical density measurements from histochemical staining. Our results demonstrate that the R2* and fL of white and cortical gray matter are well described by a sinusoidal dependence on the orientation of the tissue and a linear dependence on the volume fraction of myelin in the tissue. In deep brain gray matter structures, where there is no obvious symmetry axis, R2* and fL have no orientation dependence but retain a linear dependence on tissue iron concentration and hence {$\Delta\chi$}.},

The most commonly reported post concussion symptoms are headache, dizziness, decreased concentration, memory problems, irritability, fatigue, visual disturbances, sensitivity to noise, judgment problems, depression, and anxiety. Although these PCS often resolve within one month, in some individuals PCS can persist from months to years following injury and may even be permanent and cause disability. When this cluster of PCS is persistent in nature, it is often called the post concussion syndrome or persistent PCS. Both physiological and psychological etiologies have been suggested as causes for persistent post concussion symptoms and this has led to much controversy and debate in the literature. Most investigators now believe that a variety of pre-morbid, injury-related, and post-morbid neuropathological and psychological factors contribute to the development and continuation of these symptoms in those sustaining mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI).},

  abstract = {AIM: Dedicated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol can diagnose epileptogenic abnormalities in patients with intractable epilepsy. However, it is not sufficiently sensitive to detect small calcified lesions that may result from infections, tumors, or vascular malformations. This study aims to study the impact of the addition of T2*gradient echo/susceptibility weighted imaging (T2*GRE/SWI) sequence to a dedicated MRI protocol. METHOD: One hundred thirty-seven patients with intractable epilepsy underwent MRI using conventional epilepsy protocol with addition of T2*GRE/SWI sequence. Comparison of the images with and without these sequences was done for detection of calcified abnormalities/vascular abnormalities. In patients with calcified lesions, MRI findings were correlated either with histopathology or computerized tomography (CT) to confirm the presence of calcification. RESULTS: In 16 patients the sequence gave additional information compared to conventional imaging protocol. The sequence helped in better characterization of lesions in all patients. In three patients it helped in detecting the lesion and in another three it appeared useful as it best characterized the lesions. Additional lesions were detected in two patients with old calcified granulomas. Important additional information was supplied in four patients, whereas in the remaining patients lesion conspicuity was increased. CONCLUSION: T2*GRE/SWI sequence should form part of routine epilepsy protocol as it increases sensitivity by detecting occult calcified lesions or vascular malformations that may be responsible for the patient's seizures. This is especially important in patients from developing countries who have post-infective calcified lesions responsible for seizures and who undergo only MRI as the imaging modality for intractable seizures.},

  abstract = {Many sources of fluctuation contribute to the fMRI signal, and this makes identifying the effects that are truly related to the underlying neuronal activity difficult. Independent component analysis (ICA) - one of the most widely used techniques for the exploratory analysis of fMRI data - has shown to be a powerful technique in identifying various sources of neuronally-related and artefactual fluctuation in fMRI data (both with the application of external stimuli and with the subject "at rest"). ICA decomposes fMRI data into patterns of activity (a set of spatial maps and their corresponding time series) that are statistically independent and add linearly to explain voxel-wise time series. Given the set of ICA components, if the components representing "signal" (brain activity) can be distinguished form the "noise" components (effects of motion, non-neuronal physiology, scanner artefacts and other nuisance sources), the latter can then be removed from the data, providing an effective cleanup of structured noise. Manual classification of components is labour intensive and requires expertise; hence, a fully automatic noise detection algorithm that can reliably detect various types of noise sources (in both task and resting fMRI) is desirable. In this paper, we introduce FIX ("FMRIB's ICA-based X-noiseifier"), which provides an automatic solution for denoising fMRI data via accurate classification of ICA components. For each ICA component FIX generates a large number of distinct spatial and temporal features, each describing a different aspect of the data (e.g., what proportion of temporal fluctuations are at high frequencies). The set of features is then fed into a multi-level classifier (built around several different classifiers). Once trained through the hand-classification of a sufficient number of training datasets, the classifier can then automatically classify new datasets. The noise components can then be subtracted from (or regressed out of) the original data, to provide automated cleanup. On conventional resting-state fMRI (rfMRI) single-run datasets, FIX achieved about 95\% overall accuracy. On high-quality rfMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, FIX achieves over 99\% classification accuracy, and as a result is being used in the default rfMRI processing pipeline for generating HCP connectomes. FIX is publicly available as a plugin for FSL.},

Here we further investigated the effects of water compartmentalization on the MRI signal with the goal of extracting compartment-specific information. By comparing MRI measurements of human and marmoset brain at 7T with magnetic field modeling, we show that: (1) water between the myelin lipid bilayers, in the axonal, and in the interstitial space each experience characteristic magnetic field effects that depend on fiber orientation (2) these field effects result in characteristic relaxation properties and frequency shifts for these compartments; and (3) compartmental contributions may be separated by multi-component fitting of the MRI signal relaxation (i.e. decay) curve. We further show the potential application of these findings to the direct mapping of myelin content and assessment of WM fiber integrity with high field MRI.},

Recent work has shown that R{$_2$} (=1/T{$_2$}) may depend on the tissue's orientation relative to the static magnetic field (B(0)) and suggested that this dependence could be attributed to local anisotropy in the magnetic properties of brain tissue. In the present work, we analyzed high-resolution, multi-gradient-echo images of in vivo marmoset brains at 7T, and compared them with ex vivo diffusion tensor images, to show that R{$_2$} relaxation in white matter is highly sensitive to the fiber orientation relative to the main field. We directly demonstrate this orientation dependence by performing in vivo multi-gradient-echo experiments in two orthogonal brain positions, uncovering a nearly 50\% change in the R{$_2$} relaxation rate constant of the optic radiations. We attribute this substantial R{$_2$} anisotropy to local subvoxel susceptibility effects arising from the highly ordered and anisotropic structure of the myelin sheath.},

This finding may be of particular relevance for studies of neurodevelopment in youth, confounding analyses to the extent that motion and subject age are related. Furthermore, while Van Dijk et al. demonstrated the effect of motion on seed-based connectivity analyses, it is not known how motion impacts other common measures of connectivity. Here we expand on the findings of Van Dijk et al. by examining the effect of motion on multiple types of resting-state connectivity analyses in a large sample of children and adolescents (n=456). Following replication of the effect of motion on seed-based analyses, we examine the influence of motion on graphical measures of network modularity, dual-regression of independent component analysis, as well as the amplitude and fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation. In the entire sample, subject age was highly related to motion. Using a subsample where age and motion were unrelated, we demonstrate that motion has marked effects on connectivity in every analysis examined. While subject age was associated with increased within-network connectivity even when motion was accounted for, controlling for motion substantially attenuated the strength of this relationship. The results demonstrate the pervasive influence of motion on multiple types functional connectivity analysis, and underline the importance of accounting for motion in studies of neurodevelopment.},

In support of this, recent work by Casali et al (2013) has shown that Lempel-Ziv complexity correlates strongly with conscious level, when computed on the EEG response to transcranial magnetic stimulation. Here we investigated complexity of spontaneous high-density EEG data during propofol-induced general anaesthesia. We consider three distinct measures: (i) Lempel-Ziv complexity, which is derived from how compressible the data are; (ii) amplitude coalition entropy, which measures the variability in the constitution of the set of active channels; and (iii) the novel synchrony coalition entropy (SCE), which measures the variability in the constitution of the set of synchronous channels. After some simulations on Kuramoto oscillator models which demonstrate that these measures capture distinct `flavours' of complexity, we show that there is a robustly measurable decrease in the complexity of spontaneous EEG during general anaesthesia.},

Precise quantitative investigation of the histopathological correlates of such measures has, to date, been limited. This study investigates the relationship of quantitative measures of myelin content, axonal density, and gliosis with quantitative MR measures in postmortem (PM) MS tissue. MR imaging (MRI) was performed on a 1.5T scanner and T1-relaxation time (T1-RT) and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) maps were acquired in fresh PM brain of 20 MS subjects. Myelin content, axonal counts, and the extent of gliosis all were quantified using morphometric and digital imaging techniques. MRI and pathological data were in most cases coregistered using stereotactic navigation. Using multiple regression analysis, we detected significant correlations between myelin content (Tr(myelin)) and MTR (r = -0.84, p {$<$} 0.001) and myelin content and axonal count (-0.80, p {$<$} 0.001); MTR correlated with T1-RT (r = -0.79, p {$<$} 0.001). No association was detected between the extent of gliosis and either MR measure. MTR was significantly higher in remyelinated than demyelinated lesions (means: 30.0 [standard deviation, 2.9] vs 23.8 [standard deviation, 4.3], p = 0.008). In conclusion, MTR is affected by myelin content in MS white matter.},

Fifty-one very preterm neonates (22 males; median [interquartile range] gestational age 27.6 [2.0] weeks) underwent 3 serial scans including T1-weighted and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at median postmenstrual weeks: 29.4, 31.9, and 41.1. Thalamus, basal ganglia, and total brain volumes were segmented. Functional resting-state MRI data were extracted from the independent-components maps. Pain was operationalized as the total number of neonatal intensive care unit-administered invasive procedures. Neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18-month corrected age were assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, second edition. Generalized estimating equations assessed the association of pain and glucose exposure with brain structural and functional development. More invasive procedures were independently associated with slower growth of thalamic (P {$<$} 0.001), basal ganglia (P = 0.028), and total brain volumes (P = 0.001), particularly in females. Similar relationships were observed between glucose exposure and brain volumes. Functional connectivity between thalamus and sensorimotor cortices was negatively associated with number of invasive procedures. Greater procedural pain and higher glucose exposure were related to poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes. These findings suggest that structural and functional brain development is vulnerable to procedural pain. Glucose used for analgesia does not appear to mitigate the adverse impact of pain on brain development. The vulnerability of brain development in females towards early pain is distinct from other neonatal morbidities. The link between pain and glucose with neurodevelopment suggests that these factors have long-lasting impact.},

  abstract = {Automated medical image analysis has made significant progress over the past decades. With recent advances in acquiring high quality in vivo images of the developing human brain, analysing this data for the purpose of understanding brain development is rapidly becoming feasible. Premature birth increases the risk of developing neurocognitive and neurobehavioural disorders. Studying the morphology and function of the brain during maturation, provides us not only with a better understanding of normal development, but may help identify causes for these. A difficulty is to differentiate between neurodevelopmental consequences and normal variation. Reference models are therefore needed. This thesis presents computational methods used to obtain such models. As a prerequisite, an efficient topology-preserving registration is required. Existing methods have been evaluated mostly on adult brain images, with considerably different shape and appearance. We evaluate approaches for the fast diffeomorphic registration on a publicly available neonatal brain image dataset, and present an improved inverse consistent variant of the stationary velocity free-form deformation algorithm. We employ this algorithm for the construction of a spatio-temporal atlas of the neonatal brain, and compare two different approaches. The first approach is based on the registration of all pairs of images. Residual misalignment thereby still impacts the sharpness of the atlas. More detail is preserved with an iterative refinement of the transformations relating each image to the atlas space. We developed a second approach, which jointly estimates mean shape and longitudinal change iteratively. The final atlas demonstrates increased sharpness and temporal consistency. Finally, we present deformable models for the reconstruction of the neonatal cortex, which correct for common errors observed in state-of-the-art neonatal brain segmentations. Our models were found by experts to be superior to the original segmentation in terms of accurately delineating the cortical anatomy, and form a vital component of image processing pipelines of the Developing Human Connectome Project.},

The mechanisms of altered brain development causing these disorders are yet unknown. Studying the morphology and function of the brain during maturation provides us not only with a better understanding of normal development, but may help us to identify causes of abnormal development and their consequences. A particular difficulty is to distinguish abnormal patterns of neurodevelopment from normal variation. The Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) seeks to create a detailed four-dimensional (4D) connectome of early life. This connectome may provide insights into normal as well as abnormal patterns of brain development. As part of this project, more than a thousand healthy fetal and neonatal brains will be scanned             in vivo.             This requires computational methods which scale well to larger data sets. We propose a novel groupwise method for the construction of a spatio-temporal model of mean morphology from cross-sectional brain scans at different gestational ages. This model scales linearly with the number of images and thus improves upon methods used to build existing public neonatal atlases, which derive correspondence between all pairs of images. By jointly estimating mean shape and longitudinal change, the atlas created with our method overcomes temporal inconsistencies, which are encountered when mean shape and intensity images are constructed separately for each time point. Using this approach, we have constructed a spatio-temporal atlas from 275 healthy neonates between 35 and 44 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA). The resulting atlas qualitatively preserves cortical details significantly better than publicly available atlases. This is moreover confirmed by a number of quantitative measures of the quality of the spatial normalisation and sharpness of the resulting template brain images.},

The method is expected to be an important means to determine iron distributions in vivo and may, thus, be instrumental for elucidating the physiological role of iron and disease-related iron concentration changes associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders. This study introduces a framework for QSM and demonstrates calculation of reproducible and orientation-independent susceptibility maps from GRE data acquired at 3T. The potential of these susceptibility maps to perform anatomical imaging is investigated, as well as the ability to measure the venous blood oxygen saturation level in large vessels, and to assess the local tissue iron concentration. In order to take into account diamagnetic susceptibility contributions induced by myelin, a correction scheme for susceptibility based iron estimation is demonstrated. The findings suggest that susceptibility contrast, and therewith also phase contrast, are not only linked to the storage iron concentration but are also significantly influenced by other sources such as myelin. After myelin correction the linear dependence between magnetic susceptibilities and previously published iron concentrations from post mortem studies was significantly improved. Finally, a comparison between susceptibility maps and processed phase images indicated that caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions about iron concentrations when directly assessing processed phase information.},

  abstract = {Breathing carbogen (5\% CO2 / 95\% O2) dramatically increases cerebral blood flow (CBF), which induces a blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) related vascular signal change due to the concomitantly increased oxyhemoglobin concentration in the veins. However, carbogen often causes discomfort due to its forced strong and deep breathing which also may lead to severe motion artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging. In this study, susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) was performed with CO2 levels of 0, 1.67\%, 3.33\% and 5\% to measure the induced BOLD signal changes in venous vessels and brain tissue. Susceptibility-weighted imaging data from 15 healthy subjects and one patient with a brain tumor were acquired. The signal magnitude of cortical veins increased relative to pure oxygen by 3.5+/-3.8\%, 10.3+/-4.5\%, and 22.7+/-8.8\% for CO2 concentrations of 1.67\%, 3.33\%, and 5\%, respectively. Significant signal changes were detected in segmented white matter for 5\% CO2, and gray matter for both 3.3\% and 5\% CO2. The influence of motion artifacts was clearly traceable by the broadening of the signal distribution in segmented tissue. Heterogeneous signal changes were observed in the patient for the same tumor regions at both 3.33\% and 5\% CO2. Signal phase values of white and gray matter changed only very slightly with increasing CO2. Based on our findings we recommend the reduction of CO2 concentration to about 3\% when using a mixture of O2 and CO2. All subjects also reported highly improved breathing comfort at 3.3\% CO2 as compared to 5\%. The marginal phase change of white and gray matter supports the assumption that deoxygenated blood alone does not explain the commonly observed phase difference between the two tissues.},

METHODS: Data were acquired from two healthy controls and 22 patients undergoing MRI and SQUID-BLS as part of routine monitoring for iron overload. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on a 3T system using a three-dimensional multi-echo gradient-echo acquisition. Both magnetic susceptibility and R2* of the liver were estimated from this acquisition. Linear regression was used to compare estimates of QSM-BLS and R2* to SQUID-BLS. RESULTS: Both QSM-BLS and confounder-corrected R2* were sensitive to the presence of iron in the liver. Linear regression between QSM-BLS and SQUID-BLS demonstrated the following relationship: QSM-BLS\,=\,(-0.22\,\textpm\,0.11)\,+\,(0.49\,\textpm\,0.05) {$\cdot$} SQUID-BLS with r2 \,=\,0.88. The coefficient of determination between liver R2* and SQUID-BLS was also r2 \,=\,0.88. CONCLUSION: We determined a strong correlation between both QSM-BLS and confounder-corrected R2* to SQUID-BLS. This study demonstrates the feasibility of QSM-BLS and confounder-corrected R2* for assessing liver iron overload, particularly when SQUID systems are not accessible.

In particular, behavioral disorders characterized by inattention, social difficulties and anxiety are common among children and adolescents who were born moderately to late preterm (32--37 weeks' gestation). Diffuse deficits in white matter microstructure are thought to play a role in these poor outcomes with evidence suggesting that a failure of oligodendrocytes to mature and myelinate axons is responsible. However, there remains a major knowledge gap over the mechanisms by which preterm birth interrupts normal oligodendrocyte development.               In utero               neurodevelopment occurs in an inhibitory-dominant environment due to the action of placentally derived neurosteroids on the GABA               A               receptor, thus promoting GABAergic inhibitory activity and maintaining the fetal behavioral state. Following preterm birth, and the subsequent premature exposure to the               ex utero               environment, this action of neurosteroids on GABA               A               receptors is greatly reduced. Coinciding with a reduction in GABAergic inhibition, the preterm neonatal brain is also exposed to               ex utero               environmental insults such as periods of hypoxia and excessive glucocorticoid concentrations. Together, these insults may increase levels of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in the developing brain and result in a shift in the balance of inhibitory: excitatory activity toward excitatory. This review will outline the normal development of oligodendrocytes, how it is disrupted under excitation-dominated conditions and highlight how shifting the balance back toward an inhibitory-dominated environment may improve outcomes.},

Although the confirmation of this hypothesis would mark a significant advance in fundamental understanding of cortical physiology, a natural question arises: What functional benefits are endowed to cortical circuits that operate at criticality? In this review, we first describe an introductory-level thought experiment to provide the reader with an intuitive understanding of criticality. Second, we discuss some practical approaches for investigating criticality. Finally, we review quantitative evidence that three functional properties of the cortex are optimized at criticality: 1) dynamic range, 2) information transmission, and 3) information capacity. We focus on recently reported experimental evidence and briefly discuss the theory and history of these ideas.},

Here, we measured activity patterns obtained from multisite local field potential recordings in cortex cultures, urethane-anesthetized rats, and awake macaque monkeys. First, we quantified the information capacity of the pattern repertoire of ongoing and stimulus-evoked activity using Shannon entropy. Next, we quantified the efficacy of information transmission between stimulus and response using mutual information. By systematically changing the ratio of excitation/inhibition (E/I) in vitro and in a network model, we discovered that both information capacity and information transmission are maximized at a particular intermediate E/I, at which ongoing activity emerges as neuronal avalanches. Next, we used our in vitro and model results to correctly predict in vivo information capacity and interactions between neuronal groups during ongoing activity. Close agreement between our experiments and model suggest that neuronal avalanches and peak information capacity arise because of criticality and are general properties of cortical networks with balanced E/I.},

However, recent studies have highlighted the equal importance of white matter integrity in long-term recovery from these conditions. Demyelination is a major component of white matter injury and is characterized by loss of the myelin sheath and oligodendrocyte cell death. Demyelination contributes significantly to long-term sensorimotor and cognitive deficits because the adult brain only has limited capacity for oligodendrocyte regeneration and axonal remyelination. In the current review, we will provide an overview of the major causes of demyelination and oligodendrocyte cell death following acute brain injuries, and discuss the crosstalk between myelin, axons, microglia, and astrocytes during the process of demyelination. Recent discoveries of molecules that regulate the processes of remyelination may provide novel therapeutic targets to restore white matter integrity and improve long-term neurological recovery in stroke or TBI patients.},

Mortality was not different between sexes. The risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and combined morbidities was significantly higher in males {$\leq$}25 weeks of gestation (odds ratio [OR] 2.08, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.35--3.20 and OR 2.00, CI 1.19--3.39, respectively).

The spectrum of singularity exponents of each fMRI time series is quantified by spectral characteristics including its maximum and the corresponding dimension. We found that the range of H\"older exponents in voxels with activation is close to 1, whereas exponents are close to 0.5 in white matter voxels without activation. The maximum dimension decreases going from white matter to gray matter, and is lower still for activated time series. The full-width-at-half-maximum of the spectra is higher in activated areas. The proposed method becomes particularly effective when combining these spectral characteristics into a single parameter. Using these multifractal parameters, it is possible to identify activated areas in the human brain in both hybrid and in vivo fMRI data sets without knowledge of the stimulation paradigm applied.},

Although subtle magnetic susceptibility variations caused by iron and myelin seem to be important to this contrast, recent research on protein solutions suggests that chemical exchange between water and macromolecular protons may contribute substantially to the observed gray-white matter frequency contrast. To investigate this, we performed spectroscopic MRI experiments at 14 T on samples of fixed human visual cortex and fresh pig brain. To allow direct observation of any exchange-induced frequency shifts, these samples were soaked in reference chemicals (TSP and dioxane) that are assumed not to be involved in exchange. For both fresh and fixed tissues and with both reference chemicals, substantial negative exchange-induced gray-white matter frequency contrast (-6.3 to -13.5 ppb) was found, whereas intracortical contrast was negligible. The sign of the gray-white matter exchange-induced frequency difference was opposite to the overall gray-white matter frequency difference observed in vivo. This suggests that exchange contributes to, but is not sufficient to explain, the frequency contrast in vivo and tissue susceptibility differences may have a greater contribution than previously thought. The exchange-dependent contribution may report on tissue chemical composition and pH.},

  abstract = {Phase images in susceptibility-weighted MRI of brain provide excellent contrast. However, the phase is affected by tissue geometry and orientation relative to the main magnetic field (B(0)), and phase changes extend beyond areas of altered susceptibility. Magnetic susceptibility, on the other hand, is an intrinsic tissue property, closely reflecting tissue composition. Therefore, recently developed inverse Fourier-based methods were applied to calculate susceptibility maps from high-resolution phase images acquired at a single orientation at 7 T in the human brain (in vivo and fixed) and at 11.7 T in fixed marmoset brain. In susceptibility images, the contrast of cortical layers was more consistent than in phase images and was independent of the structures' orientation relative to B(0). The contrast of iron-rich deep-brain structures (red nucleus and substantia nigra) in susceptibility images agreed more closely with iron-dominated R(2) (*) images than the phase image contrast, which extended outside the structures. The mean susceptibility in these regions was significantly correlated with their estimated iron content. Susceptibility maps calculated using this method overcome the orientation-dependence and non-locality of phase image contrast and seem to reflect underlying tissue composition. Susceptibility images should be easier to interpret than phase images and could improve our understanding of the sources of susceptibility contrast.},

  abstract = {Objective. To examine the effects of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and very low birth weight (VLBW) on the cognitive and academic achievement of a large sample of 8-year-old children.             Methods. Infants who were VLBW and had BPD (n = 98) or did not have BPD (n = 75) and term infants (n = 99) were followed prospectively to age 8. Groups were compared on measures assessing 4 broad areas of functioning: intelligence, achievement, gross motor, and attentional skills. Measures included the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children III, the Woodcock Johnson Test of Achievement-Revised, the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, the Tactual Performance Test (spatial memory), and the Continuous Performance Test (attention). School outcomes were assessed by parent and teacher report, as well as from school records. Groups were comparable on socioeconomic status, sex, and race. The total sample of BPD, VLBW, and term children was compared on all outcome measures. In addition, neurologic risk was assessed in the present sample and included the following: intraventricular hemorrhage, echodense lesions, porencephaly, hydrocephalus, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, meningitis, and periventricular leukomalacia. Individual difference analyses were conducted for neurologically intact children in all 3 groups. Finally, treatment effects were examined by comparing BPD children who had received steroids as part of their treatment with BPD children who had not.             Results. The BPD group demonstrated deficits compared with VLBW and term children in intelligence; reading, mathematics, and gross motor skills; and special education services. VLBW children differed from term children in all of the above areas, except reading recognition, comprehension, and occupational therapy. Attentional differences were obtained between BPD and term children only. The BPD group (54\%) was more likely to be enrolled in special education classes than VLBW (37\%) or term children (25\%). In addition, more BPD children (20\%) achieved full-scale IQ scores \&lt;70, in the mental retardation range, compared with either VLBW (11\%) or term (3\%) children, with all VLBW children significantly more likely than term children to achieve IQs in the subaverage category. After controlling for birth weight and neurologic problems, BPD and/or duration on oxygen predicted lower performance IQ, perceptual organization, full-scale IQ, motor and attentional skills, and special education placement. The qualitative classification of BPD (present or absent) was a significant predictor for lower scores on measures of applied problems; motor skills; and incidence of speech-language, occupational, and physical therapies. Individual difference analyses were performed to ascertain whether differences between the risk groups were primarily attributable to neurologic complications. Even with the neurologically intact sample of BPD and VLBW children, differences between the term comparison group and both the BPD and VLBW groups were found for many outcome measures. When birth weight and neurologic complications were controlled, BPD and severity of BPD were associated with lower performance and full-scale IQ, poorer perceptual organization, attention, and motor skills, as well as lower school achievement and greater participation in special education, including occupational, physical, and speech-language therapies. Treatment protocol may in part be responsible for differences observed in our BPD sample. Steroid and nonsteroid groups of BPD children differed significantly in performance IQ (72.8 vs 84.8) and full-scale IQ (77.0 vs 85.2); perceptual organization (74.0 vs 85.2); Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency score (36.6 vs 44.7); and participation in special education (78\% vs 48\%), occupational therapy (71\% vs 44\%), and physical therapy (71\% vs 41\%). In every instance, BPD children who received steroids fared more poorly than BPD children who did not receive steroids.             Conclusions. BPD and duration on oxygen have long-term adverse effects on cognitive and academic achievement above and beyond the effects of VLBW. The problems that have been identified at 8 years of age highlight the need for continued monitoring of the learning, behavior, and development of BPD children to intervene with children who are at risk for school problems.},

The contribution of NICU care to disparities in outcomes is unclear.                                         OBJECTIVE:               To conduct a systematic review of the literature documenting racial/ethnic disparities in quality of care for infants in the NICU setting.                                         DATA SOURCES:               Medline/PubMed, Scopus, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health, and Web of Science were searched until March 6, 2018, by using search queries organized around the following key concepts: ``neonatal intensive care units,'' ``racial or ethnic disparities,'' and ``quality of care.''                                         STUDY SELECTION:               English language articles up to March 6, 2018, that were focused on racial and/or ethnic differences in the quality of NICU care were selected.                                         DATA EXTRACTION:               Two authors independently assessed eligibility, extracted data, and cross-checked results, with disagreements resolved by consensus. Information extracted focused on racial and/or ethnic disparities in quality of care and potential mechanism(s) for disparities.                                         RESULTS:               Initial search yielded 566 records, 470 of which were unique citations. Title and abstract review resulted in 382 records. Appraisal of the full text of the remaining 88 records, along with the addition of 5 citations from expert consult or review of bibliographies, resulted in 41 articles being included.                                         LIMITATIONS:               Quantitative meta-analysis was not possible because of study heterogeneity.                                         CONCLUSIONS:               Overall, this systematic review revealed complex racial and/or ethnic disparities in structure, process, and outcome measures, most often disadvantaging infants of color, especially African American infants.

  abstract = {Current evidence suggests that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) involves dysfunction in wide functional networks of brain areas associated with attention and cognition. This study examines the structural integrity of white-matter neural pathways, which underpin these functional networks, connecting fronto-striatal and fronto-parietal circuits, in children with ADHD. Fifteen right-handed 8 to 18-year-old males with ADHD-combined type and 15 right-handed, age, verbal, and performance IQ-matched, healthy males underwent diffusion tensor imaging. A recent method of tract-based spatial statistics was used to examine fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity within major white-matter pathways throughout the whole-brain. White-matter abnormalities were found in several distinct clusters within left fronto-temporal regions and right parietal-occipital regions. Specifically, participants with ADHD showed greater FA in white-matter regions underlying inferior parietal, occipito-parietal, inferior frontal, and inferior temporal cortex. Secondly, eigenvalue analysis suggests that the difference in FA in ADHD may relate to a lesser degree of neural branching within key white-matter pathways. Tractography methods showed these regions to generally form part of white-matter pathways connecting prefrontal and parieto-occipital areas with the striatum and the cerebellum. Our findings demonstrate anomalous white-matter development in ADHD in distinct cortical regions that have previously been shown to be dysfunctional or hypoactive in fMRI studies of ADHD. These data add to an emerging picture of abnormal development within fronto-parietal cortical networks that may underpin the cognitive and attentional disturbances associated with ADHD.},

  abstract = {Objective.{$\quad$}Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is now the leading cause of lung disease in US infants. In a large regional cohort, we tested the hypothesis that despite innovations in neonatal care, very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (\&lt;1500 g) with BPD had poorer developmental outcomes than nonaffected infants during the first 3 years of life, and that BPD predicted poorer outcome beyond the effects of other risk factors.             Methods.{$\quad$}Three groups of infants (122 with BPD, 84 VLBW without BPD, and 123 full-term) were followed longitudinally to 3 years of age with the Bayley Scales of Mental and Motor Development. Comparison groups of VLBW infants without BPD and full-term infants did not differ in sex, race, or socioeconomic status. Statistical analyses included hierarchical and stepwise multiple regression.             Results.{$\quad$}Infants with BPD performed more poorly at all ages. By 3 years, cognitive and/or motor development was in the range of retardation (\&lt;70 standard score) for 21\% to 22\% of infants with BPD. In multiple regression analyses controlling for socioeconomic and neonatal risk conditions, BPD had an independent negative effect on motor outcome at 3 years. Neurologic risk, a summary measure of neurologic problems other than intraventricular hemorrhage, and the presence of BPD independently predicted motor delay. By 3 years, social class, race, and neurologic risk predicted mental outcome, suggesting that the specific effects of BPD are primarily on the motor domain.             Conclusions.{$\quad$}In VLBW infants, BPD predicts poorer motor outcome at 3 years, after control for other risks. Cohorts of infants with BPD also had higher rates of mental retardation, associated with greater neurologic and social risk. These findings underscore the need for intensive prevention and habilitation efforts for this growing group of VLBW survivors, as well as investigation into the potential role of BPD in the higher rates of learning disabilities in VLBW cohorts at school age.},

  abstract = {Background               Electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) were introduced as electronic nicotine delivery systems, and have become very popular in the USA and globally. There is a paucity of data on systemic injury biomarkers of vaping in e-cig users that can be used as a noninvasive assessment of vaping-associated lung injuries. We hypothesised that characterisation of systemic biomarkers of inflammation, anti-inflammatory, oxidative stress, vascular and lipid mediators, growth factors, and extracellular matrix breakdown may provide information regarding the toxicity of vaping in e-cig users.                                         Methods                                We collected various biological fluids,                 i.e.                 plasma, urine, saliva and exhaled breath condensate (EBC), measured pulmonary function and vaping characteristics, and assessed various biomarkers in e-cig users and nonusers.                                                        Results                                The plasma samples of e-cig users showed a significant increase in biomarkers of inflammation (interleukin (IL)-1{$\beta$}, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, interferon (IFN)-{$\gamma$}, matrix metalloproteinase-9, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1) and extracellular matrix breakdown (desmosine), and decreased pro-resolving lipid mediators (resolvin D                 1                 and resolvin D                 2                 ). There was a significant increase in growth factor (endothelial growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, {$\beta$}-nerve growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor-AA, stem cell factor, hepatocyte growth factor and placental growth factor) levels in plasma of e-cig users                 versus                 nonusers. E-cig users showed a significant increase in levels of inflammatory biomarker IFN-{$\gamma$}, oxidative stress biomarker 8-isoprostane and oxidative DNA damage biomarker 8-oxo-dG in urine samples, and of inflammatory biomarker IL-1{$\beta$} in saliva samples. EBC showed a slight increase in levels of triglycerides and 8-isoprostane in e-cig users compared with normal nonusers.                                                        Conclusion               E-cig users have increased levels of biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress, reduced pro-resolving anti-inflammatory mediators, and endothelial dysfunction, which may act as risk factors for increasing susceptibility to systemic diseases. The identified noninvasive biomarkers can be used for determining e-cig vaping-associated lung injuries, and for regulatory and diagnostic aspects of vaping in humans.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the study was to evaluate the near infrared spectroscopy technique for determination of the cerebral venous oxygen saturation. By tilting the patient's head down 15 degrees, changes in OD may be caused by changes in cerebral blood volume. On the assumption that increases in cerebral blood volume consist of venous blood only, cerebral venous oxygen saturation can be calculated as the measured change in oxygenated Hb divided by the change in total Hb. Two groups of mechanically ventilated, newborn infants were investigated: 10 asphyxiated, term infants and another 22 preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. All were monitored by near infrared spectroscopy during tilting, and cerebral blood flow was estimated by the 133Xe clearance technique immediately before tilting. Cerebral venous oxygen saturation could not be calculated in 13 preterm infants, as the blood volume remained constant during tilting. In the remaining 19, cerebral venous oxygen saturation averaged 0.67 (SD = 0.09) in asphyxiated infants and 0.53 (SD = 0.15) in preterm infants (p = 0.03). The corresponding values of cerebral blood flow were closely and inversely related to oxygen extraction calculated from cerebral venous saturation as estimated by near infrared spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {There has been much recent interest in using magnetic resonance diffusion imaging to provide information about anatomical connectivity in the brain, by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water in white matter tracts. One of the measures most commonly derived from diffusion data is fractional anisotropy (FA), which quantifies how strongly directional the local tract structure is. Many imaging studies are starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical analyses, in order to localise brain changes related to development, degeneration and disease. However, optimal analysis is compromised by the use of standard registration algorithms; there has not to date been a satisfactory solution to the question of how to align FA images from multiple subjects in a way that allows for valid conclusions to be drawn from the subsequent voxelwise analysis. Furthermore, the arbitrariness of the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not yet been resolved. In this paper, we present a new method that aims to solve these issues via (a) carefully tuned non-linear registration, followed by (b) projection onto an alignment-invariant tract representation (the "mean FA skeleton"). We refer to this new approach as Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). TBSS aims to improve the sensitivity, objectivity and interpretability of analysis of multi-subject diffusion imaging studies. We describe TBSS in detail and present example TBSS results from several diffusion imaging studies.},

Methods:               In order to report on the outcomes of a cohort of moderately and late preterm infants, derived from a population-based CP Registry, a comparative analysis of data on 95 moderately preterm infants and 96 late preterm infants out of 1,016 with CP, was performed.                                         Results:               Moderately preterm neonates with CP were more likely to have a history of N-ICU admission (               p               = 0.001) and require respiratory support (               p               \&lt; 0.001) than late preterm neonates. Birth weight was significantly related to early neonatal outcome with children with lower birth weight being more likely to have a history of N-ICU admission [moderately preterm infants (               p               = 0.006)/late preterm infants (               p               \&lt; 0.001)], to require ventilator support [moderately preterm infants (               p               = 0.025)/late preterm infants (               p               = 0.014)] and not to have neonatal seizures [moderately preterm infants (               p               = 0.044)/late preterm infants (               p               = 0.263)]. In both subgroups, the majority of children had bilateral spastic CP with moderately preterm infants being more likely to have bilateral spastic CP and less likely to have ataxic CP as compared to late preterm infants (               p               = 0.006). The prevailing imaging findings were white matter lesions in both subgroups, with statistically significant difference between moderately preterm infants who required ventilator support and mainly presented with this type of lesion vs. those who did not and presented with gray matter lesions, maldevelopments or miscellaneous findings. Gross motor function was also assessed in both subgroups without significant difference. Among late preterm infants, those who needed N-ICU admission and ventilator support as neonates achieved worse fine motor outcomes than those who did not.                                         Conclusions:               Low birth weight is associated with early neonatal problems in both moderately and late preterm infants with CP. The majority of children had bilateral spastic CP and white matter lesions in neuroimaging. GMFCS levels were comparable in both subgroups while BFMF was worse in late preterm infants with a history of N-ICU admission and ventilator support.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        A 3T multimodal MRI study of healthy adults (n=19; 10 female; 21.3 - 53.4 years) was performed to investigate the relationship between fMRI long-range temporal correlations and excitatory/inhibitory balance. The study objective was to determine if the Hurst exponent (H) --- an estimate of the self-correlation and signal complexity --- of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal is correlated with the excitatory-inhibitory (E:I) ratio. E:I has been proposed to serve as a control parameter for brain criticality --- the theory that the brain operates near a critical point between order and disorder, optimizing information processing and adaptability --- which H is believed to be a measure of. Thus, understanding if H and E:I are correlated would clarify this relationship. Moreover, findings in this domain have implications for neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions with disrupted E:I balance, such as autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. From a practical perspective, H is easier to accurately measure than E:I ratio at 3T MRI. If H can serve as a proxy for E:I, it may serve as a more practical clinical biomarker for this imbalance and for neuroscience research in general. The study collected functional MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy data during rest and movie-watching. H was found to increase with movie-watching compared to rest, while E:I (glutamate/GABA) did not change between conditions. H and E:I were not correlated during either movie-watching or rest. This study represents the first attempt to investigate this connection             in vivo             in humans. We conclude that, at 3T and with our particular methodologies, no association was found. We end with lessons learned and suggestions for future research.},

  abstract = {What aspects of neuronal activity distinguish the conscious from the unconscious brain? This has been a subject of intense interest and debate since the early days of neurophysiology. However, as any practicing anesthesiologist can attest, it is currently not possible to reliably distinguish a conscious state from an unconscious one on the basis of brain activity. Here we approach this problem from the perspective of dynamical systems theory. We argue that the brain, as a dynamical system, is self-regulated at the boundary between stable and unstable regimes, allowing it in particular to maintain high susceptibility to stimuli. To test this hypothesis, we performed stability analysis of high-density electrocorticography recordings covering an entire cerebral hemisphere in monkeys during reversible loss of consciousness. We show that, during loss of consciousness, the number of eigenmodes at the edge of instability decreases smoothly, independently of the type of anesthetic and specific features of brain activity. The eigenmodes drift back toward the unstable line during recovery of consciousness. Furthermore, we show that stability is an emergent phenomenon dependent on the correlations among activity in different cortical regions rather than signals taken in isolation. These findings support the conclusion that dynamics at the edge of instability are essential for maintaining consciousness and provide a novel and principled measure that distinguishes between the conscious and the unconscious brain.   SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT  What distinguishes brain activity during consciousness from that observed during unconsciousness? Answering this question has proven difficult because neither consciousness nor lack thereof have universal signatures in terms of most specific features of brain activity. For instance, different anesthetics induce different patterns of brain activity. We demonstrate that loss of consciousness is universally and reliably associated with stabilization of cortical dynamics regardless of the specific activity characteristics. To give an analogy, our analysis suggests that loss of consciousness is akin to depressing the damper pedal on the piano, which makes the sounds dissipate quicker regardless of the specific melody being played. This approach may prove useful in detecting consciousness on the basis of brain activity under anesthesia and other settings.},

Accurate assessments of these conditions may be highly beneficial in evaluating and selecting therapeutic strategies for patient management. Recently, an analytical approach examining diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived parameters has been proposed to assess the extent of axonal damage, demyelination, or both. The current study uses the well-characterized cuprizone model of experimental demyelination and remyelination of corpus callosum in mouse brain to evaluate the ability of DTI parameters to detect the progression of myelin degeneration and regeneration. Our results demonstrate that the extent of increased radial diffusivity reflects the severity of demyelination in corpus callosum of mouse brain affected by cuprizone treatment. Subsequently, radial diffusivity decreases with the progression of remyelination. Furthermore, radial diffusivity changes were specific to the time course of changes in myelin integrity as distinct from axonal injury, which was detected by betaAPP immunostaining and shown to be most extensive prior to demyelination. Radial diffusivity offers a specific assessment of demyelination and remyelination, as distinct from acute axonal damage.},

  abstract = {Both axon and myelin degeneration have significant impact on the long-term disability of patients with white matter disorder. However, the clinical manifestations of the neurological dysfunction caused by white matter disorders are not sufficient to determine the origin of neurological deficits. A noninvasive biological marker capable of detecting and differentiating axon and myelin degeneration would be a significant addition to currently available tools. Directional diffusivities derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have been previously proposed by this group as potential biological markers to detect and differentiate axon and myelin degeneration. To further test the hypothesis that axial (lambdaparallel) and radial (lambdaperpendicular) diffusivities reflect axon and myelin pathologies, respectively, the optic nerve was examined serially using DTI in a mouse model of retinal ischemia. A significant decrease of lambdaparallel, the putative DTI axonal marker, was observed 3 days after ischemia without concurrently detectable changes in lambdaperpendicular, the putative myelin marker. This result is consistent with histological findings of significant axonal degeneration with no detectable demyelination at 3 days after ischemia. The elevation of lambdaperpendicular observed 5 days after ischemia is consistent with histological findings of myelin degeneration at this time. These results support the hypothesis that lambdaparallel and lambdaperpendicular hold promise as specific markers of axonal and myelin injury, respectively, and, further, that the coexistence of axonal and myelin degeneration does not confound this utility.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To validate the T1- and T2-weighted (T1w/T2w) MRI ratio technique in evaluating myelin in the neonatal brain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: T1w and T2w MR images of 10 term neonates with normal-appearing brain parenchyma were obtained from a single 1.5 Tesla MRI and retrospectively analyzed. T1w/T2w ratio images were created with a postprocessing pipeline and qualitatively compared with standard clinical sequences (T1w, T2w, and apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]). Quantitative assessment was also performed to assess the ratio technique in detecting areas of known myelination (e.g., posterior limb of the internal capsule) and very low myelination (e.g., optic radiations) using linear regression analysis and the Michelson Contrast equation, a measure of luminance contrast intensity. RESULTS: The ratio image provided qualitative improvements in the ability to visualize regional variation in myelin content of neonates. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a significant inverse relationship between the ratio intensity values and ADC values in the posterior limb of the internal capsule and the optic radiations (R(2) \,=\,0.96 and P\,{$<$}\,0.001). The Michelson Contrast equation showed that contrast differences between these two regions for the ratio images were 1.6 times higher than T1w, 2.6 times higher than T2w, and 1.8 times higher than ADC (all P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Finally, the ratio improved visualization of the corticospinal tract, one of the earliest myelinated pathways. CONCLUSION: The T1w/T2w ratio accentuates contrast between myelinated and less myelinated structures and may enhance our diagnostic ability to detect myelination patterns in the neonatal brain.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is long known within the mathematical literature that the coefficient of determination R(2) is an inadequate measure for the goodness of fit in nonlinear models. Nevertheless, it is still frequently used within pharmacological and biochemical literature for the analysis and interpretation of nonlinear fitting to data. RESULTS: The intensive simulation approach undermines previous observations and emphasizes the extremely low performance of R(2) as a basis for model validity and performance when applied to pharmacological/biochemical nonlinear data. In fact, with the 'true' model having up to 500 times more strength of evidence based on Akaike weights, this was only reflected in the third to fifth decimal place of R(2). In addition, even the bias-corrected R(2)(adj) exhibited an extreme bias to higher parametrized models. The bias-corrected AICc and also BIC performed significantly better in this respect. CONCLUSION: Researchers and reviewers should be aware that R(2) is inappropriate when used for demonstrating the performance or validity of a certain nonlinear model. It should ideally be removed from scientific literature dealing with nonlinear model fitting or at least be supplemented with other methods such as AIC or BIC or used in context to other models in question.},

Two exchanging liquid pools with their own, independent MT characteristics were necessary to model both the T(2) relaxation and the MT data. The model agrees well with the experimental data and yields physically realistic parameters. The MT effect for myelin water is approximately nine time larger than that for intra/intercellular water, indicating that the MT characteristics observed for white matter are mainly related to myelin. The model can be used to probe parameters that would be difficult to achieve experimentally. The exchange process between the two tissue compartments does not drastically affect the amplitudes and relaxation rates of the T(2) components, but is fast enough to significantly influence their MT characteristics. Although, both the MT and T(2) experiments described in this paper are too time consuming to be applied in routine clinical work, presented results can be useful in interpreting clinical pulse sequences that are sensitive to myelin.

  abstract = {Purpose Since quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) quantifies magnetic susceptibility relative to a reference value, a suitable reference tissue has to be available to compare different subjects and stages of disease. Methods To find such a suitable reference tissue for QSM of the brain, melanoma patients with and without brain metastases were measured. Twelve reference regions were chosen and assessed for stability of susceptibility values with respect to multiple intra-individual and inter-individual measurements, age, and stage of disease. Results Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the internal capsule and one region in the splenium of the corpus callosum are the regions with the smallest standard deviations of the mean susceptibility value. The mean susceptibility is 0.010 \textpm{} 0.014 ppm for CSF in the atrium of the lateral ventricles (csfpost), -0.060 \textpm{} 0.019 ppm for the posterior limb of the internal capsule (ci2), and -0.008 \textpm{} 0.019 ppm for the splenium of the corpus callosum. csfpost and ci2 show nearly no dependence on age or stage of disease, whereas some other regions, e.g., the red nucleus, show moderate dependence on age or disease. Conclusion The internal capsule and CSF appear to be the most suitable reference regions for QSM of the brain in the melanoma patients studied. Both showed virtually no dependence on age or disease and small variations among patients.

Experimental TAI in the corpus callosum of adult mice was used to examine the effects on oligodendrocyte lineage cells and myelin in conjunction with neuroimaging. The injury targeted the corpus callosum over the subventricular zone, a source of neural stem/progenitor cells. Traumatic axonal injury was produced in the rostral body of the corpus callosum by impact onto the skull at the bregma. During the first week after injury, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging showed that axial diffusivity decreased in the corpus callosum and that corresponding regions exhibited significant axon damage accompanied by hypertrophic microglia and reactive astrocytes. Oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation increased in the subventricular zone and corpus callosum. Oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum shifted toward upregulation of myelin gene transcription. Plp/CreER(T):R26IAP reporter mice showed normal reporter labeling of myelin sheaths 0 to 2 days after injury but labeling was increased between 2 and 7 days after injury. Electron microscopy revealed axon degeneration, demyelination, and redundant myelin figures. These findings expand the cell types and responses to white matter injuries that inform diffusion tensor imaging evaluation and identify pivotal white matter changes after TAI that may affect axon vulnerability vs. recovery after brain injury.},

Cuprizone treatment of C57BL/6 mice was a highly reproducible model of CNS white matter demyelination and remyelination affecting the corpus callosum (CC). In the present study, six C57BL/6 male mice were fed 0.2\% cuprizone for 12 weeks followed by 12 weeks of recovery on normal chow. The control mice were fed normal chow and imaged in parallel. Biweekly in vivo DTI examinations showed transient decrease of lambda(parallel) in CC at 2-6 weeks of cuprizone treatment. Immunostaining for nonphosphorylated neurofilaments demonstrated corresponding axonal damage at 4 weeks of treatment. Significant demyelination was evident from loss of Luxol fast blue staining at 6-12 weeks of cuprizone ingestion and was paralleled by increased lambda(perpendicular) values, followed by partial normalization during the remyelination phase. The sensitivity of lambda(perpendicular) to detect demyelination may be modulated in the presence of axonal damage during the early stage of demyelination at 4 weeks of cuprizone treatment. Our results suggest that lambda(parallel) and lambda(perpendicular) may be useful in vivo surrogate markers of axonal and myelin damage in mouse CNS white matter.},

Stepwise regression analyses evaluated the effect of (1) prenatal and neonatal characteristics, (2) admission severity of illness, (3) major neonatal morbidities, (4) neonatal neuroimaging abnormalities, and (5) site on neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) (Bayley-III score {$<$} 85, any CP, visual or hearing impairment), significant neurodevelopmental impairment (sNDI) (Bayley-III {$<$} 70, severe CP, blind or hearing aided and sNDI or death. RESULTS: Of the 3700 admissions without severe congenital anomalies, 84\% survived to discharge and of the 2340 admissions, 46\% (IQR site variation 38\%-51\%) had a NDI, 17\% (11\%-23\%) had a sNDI, 6.4\% (3.1\%-8.6\%) had CP, 2.6\% (2.5\%-13.3\%) had hearing aids or cochlear implants and 1.6\% (0\%-3.1\%) had a bilateral visual impairment. Bayley-III composite scores of {$<$}70 for cognitive, language and motor domains were 3.3\%, 10.9\% and 6.7\%, respectively. Gestational age, sex, outborn, illness severity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, late-onset sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity, abnormal neuroimaging and site were significantly associated with NDI or sNDI. Site variation ORs for NDI, sNDI and sNDI/death ranged from 0.3-4.3, 0.04-3.5 and 0.12-1.96, respectively. CONCLUSION: Most preterm survivors are free of sNDI. The risk factors, including site, associated with neurodevelopmental status suggest opportunities for improving outcomes.},

First, this region of the brain is notable for its loose network of axons with low myelin content. Second, pathologic scrutiny revealed an entity called "ependymitis granularis," which represents patchy loss of the ependyma in the frontal horns with astrocytic gliosis. Third, flow of interstitial fluid within this region of the brain tends to converge at the dorsal-lateral angle of the frontal horns. All these factors contribute to increased water content locally, which results in foci of high signal intensity anterior to the frontal horns in all normal MR scans.},

Current methods are based on the analysis of gradual and continuous changes in the brain blood oxygenated level dependent (BOLD) signal. Departing from that approach, recent work has shown that equivalent results can be obtained by inspecting only the relatively large amplitude BOLD signal peaks, suggesting that relevant information can be condensed in discrete events. This idea is further explored here to demonstrate how brain dynamics at resting state can be captured just by the timing and location of such events, i.e., in terms of a spatiotemporal point process. The method allows, for the first time, to define a theoretical framework in terms of an order and control parameter derived from fMRI data, where the dynamical regime can be interpreted as one corresponding to a system close to the critical point of a second order phase transition. The analysis demonstrates that the resting brain spends most of the time near the critical point of such transition and exhibits avalanches of activity ruled by the same dynamical and statistical properties described previously for neuronal events at smaller scales. Given the demonstrated functional relevance of the resting state brain dynamics, its representation as a discrete process might facilitate large-scale analysis of brain function both in health and disease.},

  abstract = {Previous research has reported on the development trajectory of the corpus callosum morphology. However, there have been only a few studies that have included data on infants. The goal of the present study was to examine the morphology of the corpus callosum in healthy participants of both sexes, from infancy to early adulthood. We sought to characterize normal development of the corpus callosum and possible sex differences in development. We performed a morphometric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of 114 healthy individuals, aged 1 month to 25 years old, measuring the size of the corpus callosum. The corpus callosum was segmented into seven subareas of the rostrum, genu, rostral body, anterior midbody, posterior midbody, isthmus and splenium. Locally weighted regression analysis (LOESS) indicated significant non-linear age-related changes regardless of sex, particularly during the first few years of life. After this increase, curve slopes gradually became flat during adolescence and adulthood in both sexes. Age of local maximum for each subarea of the corpus callosum differed across the sexes. Ratios of total corpus callosum and genu, posterior midbody, as well as splenium to the whole brain were significantly higher in females compared with males. The present results demonstrate that the developmental trajectory of the corpus callosum during early life in healthy individuals is non-linear and dynamic. This pattern resembles that found for the cerebral cortex, further suggesting that this period plays a very important role in neural and functional development. In addition, developmental trajectories and changes in growth do show some sex differences.},

  abstract = {To date, Hebbian learning combined with some form of constraint on synaptic inputs has been demonstrated to describe well the development of neural networks. The previous models revealed mathematically the importance of synaptic constraints to reproduce orientation selectivity in the visual cortical neurons, but biological mechanisms underlying such constraints remain unclear. In this study, we addressed this issue by formulating a synaptic constraint based on activity-dependent mechanisms of synaptic changes. Particularly, considering metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated long-term depression, we derived synaptic constraint that suppresses the number of inputs from individual presynaptic neurons. We performed computer simulations of the activity-dependent self-organization of geniculocortical inputs with the synaptic constraint and examined the formation of receptive fields (RFs) of model visual cortical neurons. When we changed the magnitude of the synaptic constraint, we found the emergence of distinct RF structures such as concentric RFs, simple-cell-like RFs, and double-oriented RFs and also a gradual transition between spatiotemporal separable and inseparable RFs. Thus, the model based on the synaptic constraint derived from biological consideration can account systematically for the repertoire of RF structures observed in the primary visual cortices of different species for the first time.},

  abstract = {Due to their viscoelastic nature, white matter axons are susceptible to damage by high strain rates produced during traumatic brain injury (TBI). Indeed, diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is one of the most common features of TBI, characterized by the hallmark pathological profiles of axonal bulbs at disconnected terminal ends of axons and periodic swellings along axons, known as "varicosities." Although transport interruption underlies axonal bulb formation, it is unclear how varicosities arise, with multiple sites accumulating transported materials along one axon. Recently, axonal microtubules have been found to physically break during dynamic stretch injury of cortical axons in vitro. Here, the same in vitro model was used in parallel with histopathological analyses of human brains acquired acutely following TBI to examine the potential role of mechanical microtubule damage in varicosity formation post-trauma. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) following in vitro stretch injury revealed periodic breaks of individual microtubules along axons that regionally corresponded with undulations in axon morphology. However, typically less than a third of microtubules were broken in any region of an axon. Within hours, these sites of microtubule breaks evolved into periodic swellings. This suggests axonal transport may be halted along one broken microtubule, yet can proceed through the same region via other intact microtubules. Similar axonal undulations and varicosities were observed following TBI in humans, suggesting primary microtubule failure may also be a feature of DAI. These data indicate a novel mechanism of mechanical microtubule damage leading to partial transport interruption and varicosity formation in traumatic axonal injury.},

  abstract = {The combined monitoring of oxygen supply and delivery using Near-InfraRed spectroscopy (NIRS) and cerebral activity using amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) could yield new insights into brain metabolism and detect potentially vulnerable conditions soon after birth. The relationship between NIRS and quantitative aEEG/EEG parameters has not yet been investigated. Our aim was to study the association between oxygen utilization during the first 6 h after birth and simultaneously continuously monitored brain activity measured by aEEG/EEG. Forty-four hemodynamically stable babies with a GA {$<$} 28 weeks, with good quality NIRS and aEEG/EEG data available and who did not receive morphine were included in the study. aEEG and NIRS monitoring started at NICU admission. The relation between regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) and cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (cFTOE), and quantitative measurements of brain activity such as number of spontaneous activity transients (SAT) per minute (SAT rate), the interval in seconds (i.e. time) between SATs (ISI) and the minimum amplitude of the EEG in {$\mu$}V (min aEEG) were evaluated. rScO2 was negatively associated with SAT rate ({$\beta$}=-3.45 [CI=-5.76- -1.15], p=0.004) and positively associated with ISI ({$\beta$}=1.45 [CI=0.44-2.45], p=0.006). cFTOE was positively associated with SAT rate ({$\beta$}=0.034 [CI=0.009-0.059], p=0.008) and negatively associated with ISI ({$\beta$}=-0.015 [CI=-0.026- -0.004], p=0.007). Oxygen delivery and utilization, as indicated by rScO2 and cFTOE, are directly related to functional brain activity, expressed by SAT rate and ISI during the first hours after birth, showing an increase in oxygen extraction in preterm infants with increased early electro-cerebral activity. NIRS monitored oxygenation may be a useful biomarker of brain vulnerability in high-risk infants.},

  abstract = {Recently evidence has accumulated that many neural networks exhibit self-organized criticality. In this state, activity is similar across temporal scales and this is beneficial with respect to information flow. If subcritical, activity can die out, if supercritical epileptiform patterns may occur. Little is known about how developing networks will reach and stabilize criticality. Here we monitor the development between 13 and 95 days in vitro (DIV) of cortical cell cultures (n = 20) and find four different phases, related to their morphological maturation: An initial low-activity state ({$\approx$}19 DIV) is followed by a supercritical ({$\approx$}20 DIV) and then a subcritical one ({$\approx$}36 DIV) until the network finally reaches stable criticality ({$\approx$}58 DIV). Using network modeling and mathematical analysis we describe the dynamics of the emergent connectivity in such developing systems. Based on physiological observations, the synaptic development in the model is determined by the drive of the neurons to adjust their connectivity for reaching on average firing rate homeostasis. We predict a specific time course for the maturation of inhibition, with strong onset and delayed pruning, and that total synaptic connectivity should be strongly linked to the relative levels of excitation and inhibition. These results demonstrate that the interplay between activity and connectivity guides developing networks into criticality suggesting that this may be a generic and stable state of many networks in vivo and in vitro.},

  abstract = {Background Dementia is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) but measures that track cognitive change in PD are lacking. Brain tissue iron accumulates with age and co-localises with pathological proteins linked to PD dementia such as amyloid. We used quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) to detect changes related to cognitive change in PD. Methods We assessed 100 patients with early-stage to mid-stage PD, and 37 age-matched controls using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a validated clinical algorithm for risk of cognitive decline in PD, measures of visuoperceptual function and the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part 3 (UPDRS-III). We investigated the association between these measures and QSM, an MRI technique sensitive to brain tissue iron content. Results We found QSM increases (consistent with higher brain tissue iron content) in PD compared with controls in prefrontal cortex and putamen (p{$<$}0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons). Whole brain regression analyses within the PD group identified QSM increases covarying: (1) with lower MoCA scores in the hippocampus and thalamus, (2) with poorer visual function and with higher dementia risk scores in parietal, frontal and medial occipital cortices, (3) with higher UPDRS-III scores in the putamen (all p{$<$}0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons). In contrast, atrophy, measured using voxel-based morphometry, showed no differences between groups, or in association with clinical measures. Conclusions Brain tissue iron, measured using QSM, can track cognitive involvement in PD. This may be useful to detect signs of early cognitive change to stratify groups for clinical trials and monitor disease progression.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To provide further quantitative studies concerning the relationship with age between regional brain iron and T2 shortening. METHODS: a) Quantitative T2 calculations of eight anatomic regions (red nucleus, substantia nigra, dentate nucleus, corpus callosum, caudate, putamen, temporal lobe white matter, and frontal lobe white matter) from T2-weighted spin-echo images were performed in 60 patients aged newborn to 35 years. b) Quantitative brain iron concentrations were obtained in six of the eight anatomic regions (red nucleus, substantia nigra, dentate nucleus, corpus callosum, cauda, and putamen) using 13 autopsied brains (newborn to 78 years). Brain tissue from these six regions was digested with 0.6 N HCl-2.5\% wt/vol KMnO4 for 2 hours at 60 degrees C. After centrifugation, 0.1 mL of an iron-chelating reagent (2 mol/L ascorbic acid, 5 mol/L ammonium acetate, 6.5 nmol/L ferrozine, 13.1 mmol/L neocuprine) was added and the absorbance was measured at 562 nm/L and compared with a standard curve with ferric chloride. c) The in vivo iron concentrations in tissue that were obtained were reproduced in four test tube phantom studies with ferric ammonium sulfate or ferrous ammonium sulfate dissolved in either deionized water or 5\% agarose. T2 calculations of the phantoms were made with a single-section multiple repetition time, multiple echo time acquisition. RESULTS: a) Clinical T2 calculations--all eight anatomic regions showed a decrease with age in T2 value, beginning shortly after birth. During the first three decades, the T2 shortening was most significant in the region of substantia nigra. b) Quantitative brain iron--five anatomic regions but not the corpus callosum demonstrated an age-related increase in brain iron (1449.6 nmol/g for the red nucleus versus 261.8 nmol/g for the corpus callosum). c) T2 effect of iron in vitro--both the ferric and ferrous iron phantoms showed a decreased T2 value in the in vivo concentration range of iron obtained from the postmortem studies. The T2 shortening was most marked for the ferric phantoms. CONCLUSION: There is an age-related accumulation of iron in five regions of the brain, correlating with an associated decrease in T2 value that can be demonstrated in iron phantoms. Brain iron appears to contribute to the progressive decrease of T2 signal that occurs with aging.},

  abstract = {Information processing in the cerebral cortex involves interactions among distributed areas. Anatomical connectivity suggests that certain areas form local hierarchical relations such as within the visual system. Other connectivity patterns, particularly among association areas, suggest the presence of large-scale circuits without clear hierarchical relations. In this study the organization of networks in the human cerebrum was explored using resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using surface-based alignment. A clustering approach was employed to identify and replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined to sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of association regions. Within the sensory and motor cortices, functional connectivity followed topographic representations across adjacent areas. In association cortex, the connectivity patterns often showed abrupt transitions between network boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better understand properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal area complex (MT+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye field was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the MT+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with a hierarchical pathway that spans networks. The functional connectivity of parietal and prefrontal association cortices was next explored. Distinct connectivity profiles of neighboring regions suggest they participate in distributed networks that, while showing evidence for interactions, are embedded within largely parallel, interdigitated circuits. We conclude by discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral networks in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential evolutionary expansion in humans to support cognition.},

DESIGN: Prospective, hospital based cohort study, with one year follow up of sample stratified by coma score. SETTING: Five acute hospitals in Glasgow. SUBJECTS: 2962 patients (aged 14 years or more) with head injury; 549 (71\%) of the 769 patients selected for follow up participated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Glasgow outcome scale and problem orientated questionnaire. RESULTS: Survival with moderate or severe disability was common after mild head injury (47\%, 95\% confidence interval 42\% to 52\%) and similar to that after moderate (45\%, 35\% to 56\%) or severe injury (48\%, 36\% to 60\%). By extrapolation from the population identified (90\% of whom had mild injuries), it was estimated that annually in Glasgow (population 909 498) 1400 young people and adults are still disabled one year after head injury. CONCLUSION: The incidence of disability in young people and adults admitted with a head injury is higher than expected. This reflects the high rate of sequelae previously unrecognised in the large number of patients admitted to hospital with an apparently mild head injury.},

While considerable evidence generally supports this hypothesis, nonnegligible controversies persist regarding the ubiquity of criticality in neural dynamics and its role in information processing. Validity issues frequently arise during identifying potential brain criticality from empirical data. Moreover, the functional benefits implied by brain criticality are frequently misconceived or unduly generalized. These problems stem from the nontriviality and immaturity of the physical theories that analytically derive brain criticality and the statistic techniques that estimate brain criticality from empirical data. To help solve these problems, we present a systematic review and reformulate the foundations of studying brain criticality, that is, ordinary criticality (OC), quasi-criticality (qC), self-organized criticality (SOC), and self-organized quasi-criticality (SOqC), using the terminology of neuroscience. We offer accessible explanations of the physical theories and statistical techniques of brain criticality, providing step-by-step derivations to characterize neural dynamics as a physical system with avalanches. We summarize error-prone details and existing limitations in brain criticality analysis and suggest possible solutions. Moreover, we present a forward-looking perspective on how optimizing the foundations of studying brain criticality can deepen our understanding of various neuroscience questions.},

In this report, we provide data that identify myelin and fatty-acid biosynthesis dysfunction in schizophrenia based on post-mortem brain studies (prefrontal cortex) utilizing parallel metabolic and transcriptomics investigations. We detected a significant up-regulation of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) by HPLC analysis. Microarray and Q-PCR investigations revealed mRNA abnormalities for several enzymes involved in NAA metabolism. Additionally, glutamatergic neurotransmission components were also found to be affected. Our results suggest that, apart from the previously reported alterations in myelin-related protein synthesis, myelin synthesis itself may be directly affected in schizophrenia as indicated by changes in key enzymes involved in NAA metabolism. A decrease in NAA catabolism in oligodendrocytes would severely reduce acetate levels required to produce myelin lipids and may subsequently affect glutamatergic neurotransmission.},

The electronic databases were searched for titles or abstracts containing these terms in all published articles between January 1, 1970, and June 30, 2019. Over 3000 articles were found in the first round of search which was filtered to 129 articles. RESULTS: Oxidative Stress is a critical underlying molecular factor that drives the harmful effects of traditional cigarettes.~The developing brain is particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of oxidative stress and e-cigarettes just like traditional cigarettes induces oxidative stress. Many e-cigarette components including the flavoring, vapor, e-liquids and metallic coil, trigger oxidative stress, indicating that both nicotine and non-nicotine e-cigarette use may be harmful. CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarettes use could potentially play a role in adolescent/young adults social maladjustments including poor learning and academic performance, increased aggressive and impulsive behavior, poor sleep quality, attention deficits, impaired memory, and cognition, and increased depression and suicidal ideation. The government, parents, school authorities and clinicians should be advised on these potentially harmful effects.},

  abstract = {In a well-regulated control system, excitatory and inhibitory components work closely together with minimum lag; in response to inputs of finite duration, outputs should show rapid rise and, following the input's termination, immediate return to baseline. The efficiency of this response can be quantified using the power spectrum density's scaling parameter {$\beta$}, a measure of self-similarity, applied to the first-derivative of the raw signal. In this study, we adapted power spectrum density methods, previously used to quantify autonomic dysregulation (heart rate variability), to neural time-series obtained via functional MRI. The negative feedback loop we investigated was the limbic system, using affect-valent faces as stimuli. We hypothesized that trait anxiety would be related to efficiency of regulation of limbic responses, as quantified by power law scaling of fMRI time series. Our results supported this hypothesis, showing moderate to strong correlations of {$\beta$} (r = 0.4--0.54) for the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, superior temporal gyrus, posterior insula, and anterior cingulate. Strong anticorrelations were also found between the amygdala's {$\beta$} and wake heart rate variability (r = -0.61), suggesting a robust relationship between dysregulated limbic outputs and their autonomic consequences.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven young patients with a mean Glasgow Coma Scale score of 7 +/- 4 (SD) at admission were imaged a mean of 5 days +/- 3 after injury. High-spatial-resolution three-dimensional GRE imaging performed with postprocessing by using a normalized phase mask was compared with conventional GRE MR imaging. The total and mean values of lesion number and apparent hemorrhage volume load determined with both examinations were compared. Mean values were compared by using paired t test analysis. Differences were considered to be significant at P {$<$} or =.05. RESULTS: Hemorrhagic lesions were much more visible on SW MR images than on conventional GRE MR images. SW MR imaging depicted 1,038 hemorrhagic DAI lesions with an apparent total hemorrhage volume of 57,946 mm3. GRE MR imaging depicted 162 lesions with an apparent total hemorrhage volume of 28,893 mm3. SW MR imaging depicted a significantly higher mean number of lesions in all patients than did GRE MR imaging, according to results of visual (P =.004) and computer (P =.004) counting analyses. The mean hemorrhage volume load for all patients also was significantly greater (P =.014) by using SW MR imaging according to computer analysis. SW MR imaging appeared to depict much smaller hemorrhagic lesions than GRE MR imaging. The majority (59\%) of individual hemorrhagic DAI lesions seen on SW MR images were small in area ({$<$}10 mm(2)), whereas the majority (43\%) of lesions seen on GRE images were larger in area (10-20 mm(2)). CONCLUSION: SW MR imaging depicts significantly more small hemorrhagic lesions than does conventional GRE MR imaging and therefore has the potential to improve diagnosis of DAI.},

The aim of this study was to compare the anatomy of cerebral subependymal veins evaluated on SWI venography in 3 groups of neonates with normal brain MR imaging (very preterm [gestational age {$<$}32 weeks], moderate-to-late preterm [gestational age {$\geq$}32 to {$\leq$}37 weeks], and term neonates [gestational age {$>$}37 weeks]) and to evaluate the influence of preterm birth on development of subependymal veins. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SWI venographies of 84 very preterm, 31 moderate-to-late preterm, and 50 term neonates were retrospectively evaluated. Subependymal vein anatomy was classified into 6 different patterns: type 1 represented the classic pattern and types 2-6 were considered anatomic variants. A {$\chi$}2 test was used to evaluate differences between the distributions of subependymal vein patterns. RESULTS: A significant difference (P = .011) was noticed between the 6 patterns based on gestational age. Type 1 was more frequent in term neonates (68\%) than in both very preterm (41.7\%) and moderate-to-late preterm neonates (56.5\%). Anatomic variants were more common in very preterm neonates (66\%) than in both moderate-to-late preterm (41\%) and term neonates (36\%). Interhemispheric asymmetry was more frequent in very preterm (59.5\%) and moderate-to-late preterm neonates (51.6\%) than in term neonates (34\%; P = .017). Sex and monozygotic twin birth did not significantly affect the frequency of subependymal vein patterns (P = .0962). CONCLUSIONS: The deep venous system of the neonatal brain shows a large spectrum of anatomic variants with higher variability of subependymal vein anatomy in preterm than term neonates, likely related to the influence of the preterm birth and epigenetic factors on subependymal vein development.},

  abstract = {Excitation-inhibition (E:I) imbalance is theorized as an important pathophysiological mechanism in autism. Autism affects males more frequently than females and sex-related mechanisms (e.g., X-linked genes, androgen hormones) can influence E:I balance. This suggests that E:I imbalance may affect autism differently in males versus females. With a combination of in-silico modeling and in-vivo chemogenetic manipulations in mice, we first show that a time-series metric estimated from fMRI BOLD signal, the Hurst exponent (H), can be an index for underlying change in the synaptic E:I ratio. In autism we find that H is reduced, indicating increased excitation, in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) of autistic males but not females. Increasingly intact MPFC H is also associated with heightened ability to behaviorally camouflage social-communicative difficulties, but only in autistic females. This work suggests that H in BOLD can index synaptic E:I ratio and that E:I imbalance affects autistic males and females differently.           ,              Autism is a condition that is usually diagnosed early in life that affects how a person communicates and socializes, and is often characterized by repetitive behaviors. One key theory of autism is that it reflects an imbalance in levels of excitation and inhibition in the brain. Excitatory signals are those that make other brain cells more likely to become active; inhibitory signals have the opposite effect. In non-autistic individuals, inhibitory activity outweighs excitatory activity. In people with autism, by contrast, an increase in excitatory activity is believed to produce an imbalance in excitation and inhibition.             Most of the evidence to support this excitation-inhibition imbalance theory has come from studies of rare mutations that cause autism. Many of these mutations occur on the sex chromosomes or are influenced by androgen hormones (hormones that usually play a role on typically male traits). However, most people with autism do not possess these particular mutations. It was thus unclear whether the theory could apply to everyone with autism or, for example, whether it may better apply to specific groups of individuals based on their sex or gender. This is especially important given that about four times as many men and boys compared to women and girls are diagnosed with autism.             Trakoshis, Mart\'inez-Ca\~nada et al. have now found a way to ask whether any imbalance in excitation and inhibition in the brain occurs differently in men and women. Using computer modeling, they identified a signal in brain scans that corresponds to an imbalance of excitation and inhibition. After showing that the technique works to identify real increases in excitation in the brain scans of mice, Trakoshis, Mart\'inez-Ca\~nada et al. looked for this signal, or biomarker, in brain scans of people with and without autism. All the people in the study identified with the gender that matched the sex they were assigned at birth. The results revealed differences between the men and women with autism. Men with autism showed an imbalance in excitation and inhibition in specific `social brain' regions including the medial prefrontal cortex, but women with autism did not. Notably, many of these brain regions are strongly affected by androgen hormones.             Previous studies have found that women with autism are sometimes better at hiding or `camouflaging' their difficulties when socializing or communicating than men with autism. Trakoshis, Mart\'inez-Ca\~nada et al. showed that the better a woman was at camouflaging her autism, the more her brain activity in this region resembled that of non-autistic women.             Excitation-inhibition imbalance may thus affect specific brain regions involved in socializing and communication more in men who have autism than in women with the condition. Balanced excitation and inhibition in these brain areas may enable some women with autism to camouflage their difficulties socializing or communicating. Being able to detect imbalances in activity using standard brain imaging could be useful for clinical trials. Future studies could use this biomarker to monitor responses to drug treatments that aim to adjust the balance between excitation and inhibition.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The neuropsychological effects of chronic subthalamic nucleus (STN)-deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a treatment for Parkinson's disease are variable. Whether these side effects result from the target per se or current diffusion into neighboring structures is uncertain. In this study, the relationship between clinical outcomes and coordinates of active contact are analyzed and compared between patients with and without neuropsychological sequelae. METHODS: Thirty-eight Parkinsonian patients who underwent bilateral STN-DBS were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. They were followed for at least 12 months. During the follow-up period, they were divided into two groups for comparison; Group A included patients with neuropsychological side effects and Group B was composed of patients without neuropsychological side effects. The position of the active contact of the electrode was defined with postoperative magnetic resonance imaging scans according to the midcommissural line. Active contact coordinates and clinical outcomes were compared for the two groups. RESULTS: Among the 38 Parkinsonian patients who underwent STN-DBS, eight patients who had neuropsychological side effects were assigned to Group A; the other 30 patients were assigned to Group B. In Groups A and B, the mean follow-up periods were 13.9 and 12.1 months, respectively, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score was improved by 53.4 and 45.2\% (P = 0.24), respectively, and the levodopa equivalent daily dosage was decreased by 68.4 and 46.4\% (P = 0.16), respectively. The mean coordinates of active contact in both Groups A and B were x = 10.1 and 10.5 mm, respectively, y = -2.8 and -3.9 mm, respectively, and z = -6.3 and -6.2 mm, respectively, relative to the midcommissural point. A significant difference was observed on the y axis (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: When taking spatial influence into consideration, the neuropsychological effects of chronic STN-DBS were related to a significant anteriorly located active contact within the ventral STN in this preliminary study. This might suggest the existence of topography of STN in patients with Parkinson's disease concerning limbic and associative circuits.},

Although emerging evidence suggests that MeCP2 deficiency is associated with dysregulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), which functions as a hub for various signaling pathways, the mechanism underlying this association and the molecular pathophysiology of RTT remain elusive. We show here that MeCP2 promotes the posttranscriptional processing of particular microRNAs (miRNAs) as a component of the microprocessor Drosha complex. Among the MeCP2-regulated miRNAs, we found that miR-199a positively controls mTOR signaling by targeting inhibitors for mTOR signaling. miR-199a and its targets have opposite effects on mTOR activity, ameliorating and inducing RTT neuronal phenotypes, respectively. Furthermore, genetic deletion of miR-199a-2 led to a reduction of mTOR activity in the brain and recapitulated numerous RTT phenotypes in mice. Together, these findings establish miR-199a as a critical downstream target of MeCP2 in RTT pathogenesis by linking MeCP2 with mTOR signaling.},

  abstract = {The primary target in multiple sclerosis (MS) is believed to be either myelin itself (myelinopathy) or the myelin-forming cell, the oligodendrocyte (oligodendrogliopathy). Although axonal injury occurs in MS, it is regarded as a secondary event to the myelin damage. Here, the lesion develops from myelin (outside) to the axon (inside) (Outside-In model). Recently, gray matter lesions and axonal injury in normal-appearing white matter have also been reported in MS. This raises two questions. 1) Is axonal injury exclusively secondary to myelin damage or from a direct insult to the axon or neurons (axonopathy)? (2) Is the injured axon regarded as only an end result of pathology or disease, or can axonal injury contribute to the spread of secondary damage, including demyelination? The former is raised from the fact that axonal damage has been reported in several virus infections, including human immunodeficiency virus, human T-lymphotropic virus 1, herpes simplex virus and coronavirus, which also cause demyelination. The latter possibility where axonal injury leads to other changes is raised from the rather unexpected similarity between spinal cord injury (SCI) and MS where axonal injury, oligodendrocyte apoptosis and demyelination are all present. In SCI, transection of axons leads to delayed oligodendrocyte apoptosis with secondary demyelination. Neurofilament immunostaining of spinal cord sections demonstrates that axonal injury with oligodendrocyte apoptosis also precedes demyelination in an animal model for MS, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus infection. This implies that axonal injury could trigger demyelination. In this instance, lesions develop from the axon (inside) to the myelin (outside) (Inside-Out model).},

In regions of fiber crossing the diffusion signal exhibited multiple local maxima/minima as a function of diffusion gradient orientation, indicating the presence of multiple intravoxel fiber orientations. The multimodality of the observed diffusion signal precluded the standard tensor reconstruction, so instead the diffusion signal was modeled as arising from a discrete mixture of Gaussian diffusion processes in slow exchange, and the underlying mixture of tensors was solved for using a gradient descent scheme. The multitensor reconstruction resolved multiple intravoxel fiber populations corresponding to known fiber anatomy. Ma},

Due to the subjectivity and time requirements in manual measurement of cortical thickness, scientists have relied on robust software tools for automation which facilitate the testing and refinement of neuroscientific hypotheses. The most widely used tool for cortical thickness studies is the publicly available, surface-based FreeSurfer package. Critical to the adoption of such tools is a demonstration of their reproducibility, validity, and the documentation of specific implementations that are robust across large, diverse imaging datasets. To this end, we have developed the automated, volume-based Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) cortical thickness pipeline comprising well-vetted components such as SyGN (multivariate template construction), SyN (image registration), N4 (bias correction), Atropos (n-tissue segmentation), and DiReCT (cortical thickness estimation). In this work, we have conducted the largest evaluation of automated cortical thickness measures in publicly available data, comparing FreeSurfer and ANTs measures computed on 1205 images from four open data sets (IXI, MMRR, NKI, and OASIS), with parcellation based on the recently proposed Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) cortical labeling protocol. We found good scan-rescan repeatability with both FreeSurfer and ANTs measures. Given that such assessments of precision do not necessarily reflect accuracy or an ability to make statistical inferences, we further tested the neurobiological validity of these approaches by evaluating thickness-based prediction of age and gender. ANTs is shown to have a higher predictive performance than FreeSurfer for both of these measures. In promotion of open science, we make all of our scripts, data, and results publicly available which complements the use of open image data sets and the open source availability of the proposed ANTs cortical thickness pipeline.},

Given the superb performance of N3 and its public availability, it has been the subject of several evaluation studies. These studies have demonstrated the importance of certain parameters associated with the B-spline least-squares fitting. We propose the substitution of a recently developed fast and robust B-spline approximation routine and a modified hierarchical optimization scheme for improved bias field correction over the original N3 algorithm. Similar to the N3 algorithm, we also make the source code, testing, and technical documentation of our contribution, which we denote as "N4ITK," available to the public through the Insight Toolkit of the National Institutes of Health. Performance assessment is demonstrated using simulated data from the publicly available Brainweb database, hyperpolarized (3)He lung image data, and 9.4T postmortem hippocampus data.},

This approach is possible because R               2               is directly affected by changes in CBF, CBV, CMRO               2               , and hematocrit (Hct), a phenomena better known as the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) effect. Changes in CBF and CBV were accomplished by altering the carbon dioxide pressure, Paco               2               , over a range from 20 to 140 mm Hg. For each Paco               2               value, R               2               in gray and white matter were determined using MRI, and the whole-brain oxygen extraction ratio was obtained from arteriovenous differences (sagittal sinus catheter). Assuming a constant CMRO               2               , the microvascular CBV was obtained from an exact fit to the BOLD theory for the spin-echo effect. The resulting CBV values at normal Paco               2               and normalized to a common total hemoglobin concentration of 6.88 mmol/L were 42 \textpm 18 {$\mu$}L/g (n = 7) and 29 \textpm 19 {$\mu$}L/g (n = 5) for gray and white matter, respectively, in good agreement with the range of literature values published using independent methodologies. The present study confirms the validity of the spin-echo BOLD theory and, in addition, shows that blood volume can be quantified from the magnetic resonance imaging spin relaxation rate R               2               using a regulated carbon dioxide experiment.},

  abstract = {Abstract           The excitation/inhibition (E/I) ratio has been shown to be imbalanced in individuals diagnosed with autism (AT) or schizophrenia (SZ), relative to neurotypically developed controls (TD). However, the degree of E/I imbalance overlap between SZ and AT has not been extensively compared. Our main objectives were (1) to quantify group differences in the E/I ratio between TD, AT, and SZ, (2) to assess the potential of the E/I ratio for differential diagnosis, and (3) to verify the replicability of our findings in a second, independently-acquired dataset. For each participant, we computed the Hurst exponent (H), an indicator of the E/I ratio, from the timecourses of 53 independent components covering the entire brain. Using Random Forest (RF), we ran a classification analysis using the largerof the two datasets (exploratory dataset; 519 TD, 200 AT, 355 SZ) to determine which of the 53 H would yield the highest performance in classifying SZ and AT. Next, taking the ten most important H from the exploratory dataset and the clinical and phenotypic information collected in the replication dataset (55 TD, 30 AT, 39 SZ), we used RF to compare classification performance using five feature sets: (a) H only; (b) Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) only; (c) PANSS, ADOS, Bermond--Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire (BVAQ), Empathy Quotient (EQ), and IQ; (d) H, PANSS and ADOS; (e) H, PANSS, ADOS, BVAQ, EQ and IQ. Classification performance using H only was higher in the exploratory dataset (AUC = 84\%) compared to the replication dataset (AUC = 72\%). In the replication dataset, the highest classification performance was obtained when combining H with PANSS, ADOS, BVAQ, EQ and IQ (i.e., model e; AUC = 83\%).},

  abstract = {Children born very preterm (VPT; {$<$}32\,weeks gestational age [GA]) are at greater risk for a range of cognitive deficits that typically manifest at school age. Here we examine the hypothesis that these children have altered myelin maturational that can be detected by myelin sensitive MRI measures prior to school age. We included 33 four-year old children born VPT (mean GA; 28.7\,weeks) and 23 four-year old full term (FT) children and completed magnetization transfer (MT), T1-weighted (T1-w) and T2-weighted (T1-w) magnetic resonance imaging as well as developmental assessments. Both MT ratio (MTR) and T1-w/T2-w ratio images were calculated, and group differences were probed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) in white matter, and region of interest (ROI) analysis in white, subcortical gray and cortical gray matter. The relations between MTR and T1-w/T2-w ratio, as well as with developmental assessments, were investigated in all three brain divisions. In children born VPT, TBSS and ROI analysis revealed that both MTR and T1-w/T2-w ratio were significantly reduced in white matter compared to children born FT. ROI analysis showed reductions in T1-w/T2-w ratio in VPT children compared to FT children in the thalamus, putamen and amygdala, as well as in the occipital and temporal lobes. Across the VPT and FT children, T1-w/T2-w ratio and MTR were highly correlated across white, subcortical gray and cortical gray matter. Both measures correlated positively with developmental assessments in individual white matter tracts and cortical and subcortical ROIs, suggesting that higher MTR and T1-w/T2-w ratio is related to better cognitive performance. Together these findings are consistent with delayed myelination in VPT born children.},

  abstract = {Functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) has been widely applied to explore group and individual differences. A confounding factor is head motion. Children move more than adults, older adults more than younger adults, and patients more than controls. Head motion varies considerably among individuals within the same population. Here we explored the influence of head motion on fcMRI estimates. Mean head displacement, maximum head displacement, the number of micro movements ({$>$}0.1 mm), and head rotation were estimated in 1000 healthy, young adult subjects each scanned for two resting-state runs on matched 3T scanners. The majority of fcMRI variation across subjects was not linked to head motion. However, head motion had significant, systematic effects on fcMRI network measures. Head motion was associated with decreased functional coupling in the default and frontoparietal control networks--two networks characterized by coupling among distributed regions of association cortex. Other network measures increased with motion including estimates of local functional coupling and coupling between left and right motor regions--a region pair sometimes used as a control in studies to establish specificity. Comparisons between groups of individuals with subtly different levels of head motion yielded difference maps that could be mistaken for neuronal effects in other contexts. These effects are important to consider when interpreting variation between groups and across individuals.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean, longitudinal, and transverse diffusivity are compared between control subjects and MS patients, which were subdivided as mildly and moderately impaired. In addition, PASAT scores are correlated for both MS groups with the diffusion measures. An optimized voxel based analysis (VBA) method, in terms of coregistration, atlas construction, and image smoothing, was thereby used. RESULTS: Diffusion differences between the control subjects and the patients with MS were found in the corpus callosum, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, cortico spinal tracts, forceps major, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and cingulum. In addition, we observed significant correlations of the FA and PASAT scores in the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the forceps minor, the capsula interna and externa, the genu of the corpus callosum, the left cingulum, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, and the corona radiata. CONCLUSION: Diffusion differences were observed between the mildly impaired MS patients and control subjects. In addition, different diffusion measures correlated with PASAT scores for cognitive decline in parietal, frontal, as well as temporal white matter (WM) regions.},

In conclusion, preterm boys have higher clinical instability and greater need for invasive interventions than preterm girls. This leads to a male disadvantage in mortality and short-term complications of prematurity.},

  abstract = {Early brain development, from the embryonic period to infancy, is characterized by rapid structural and functional changes. These changes can be studied using structural and physiological neuroimaging methods. In order to optimally acquire and accurately interpret this data, concepts from adult neuroimaging cannot be directly transferred. Instead, one must have a basic understanding of fetal and neonatal structural and physiological brain development, and the important modulators of this process. Here, we first review the major developmental milestones of transient cerebral structures and structural connectivity (axonal connectivity) followed by a summary of the contributions from ex vivo and in vivo MRI. Next, we discuss the basic biology of neuronal circuitry development (synaptic connectivity, i.e. ensemble of direct chemical and electrical connections between neurons), physiology of neurovascular coupling, baseline metabolic needs of the fetus and the infant, and functional connectivity (defined as statistical dependence of low-frequency spontaneous fluctuations seen with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)). The complementary roles of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) are discussed. We include a section on modulators of brain development where we focus on the placenta and emerging placental MRI approaches. In each section we discuss key technical limitations of the imaging modalities and some of the limitations arising due to the biology of the system. Although neuroimaging approaches have contributed significantly to our understanding of early brain development, there is much yet to be done and a dire need for technical innovations and scientific discoveries to realize the future potential of early fetal and infant interventions to avert long term disease.},

  abstract = {The default mode network (DMN) has been traditionally assumed to hinder behavioral performance in externally focused, goal-directed paradigms and to provide no active contribution to human cognition. However, recent evidence suggests greater DMN activity in an array of tasks, especially those that involve self-referential and memory-based processing. Although data that robustly demonstrate a comprehensive functional role for DMN remains relatively scarce, the global workspace framework, which implicates the DMN in global information integration for conscious processing, can potentially provide an explanation for the broad range of higher-order paradigms that report DMN involvement. We used graph theoretical measures to assess the contribution of the DMN to global functional connectivity dynamics in 22 healthy volunteers during an fMRI-basedn-back working-memory paradigm with parametric increases in difficulty. Our predominant finding is that brain modularity decreases with greater task demands, thus adapting a more global workspace configuration, in direct relation to increases in reaction times to correct responses. Flexible default mode regions dynamically switch community memberships and display significant changes in their nodal participation coefficient and strength, which may reflect the observed whole-brain changes in functional connectivity architecture. These findings have important implications for our understanding of healthy brain function, as they suggest a central role for the DMN in higher cognitive processing.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe default mode network (DMN) has been shown to increase its activity during the absence of external stimulation, and hence was historically assumed to disengage during goal-directed tasks. Recent evidence, however, implicates the DMN in self-referential and memory-based processing. We provide robust evidence for this network's active contribution to working memory by revealing dynamic reconfiguration in its interactions with other networks and offer an explanation within the global workspace theoretical framework. These promising findings may help redefine our understanding of the exact DMN role in human cognition.},

The MTR has been proposed as a marker for myelin in central nervous system tissue. However, changes in WC due to inflammation and edema may also affect the MTR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven MS subjects with active disease and seven age- and gender-matched controls were scanned using quantitative magnetic resonance techniques. WC, myelin water content, T(1) relaxation time, and MTR were calculated from areas of lesion (divided into new lesions less than 2 months old, isointense T(1) lesions, and hypointense T(1) lesions), contralateral normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), and location-matched normal white matter (NWM) in controls. Linear regression was used to determine the correlation between WC and MTR. RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between WC and MTR across all tissue (R = -0.65, P {$<$} 0.0005). CONCLUSION: MTR was correlated with WC in MS tissue, indicating that inflammation and edema influence MTR. Therefore, caution should be used when associating MTR exclusively with myelin content.},

This study compares brain responses with physician determined signs and symptoms of concussion to investigate tissue-level injury mechanisms. METHODS: The Wayne State University Head Injury Model (Version 2001) was used because it has fine anatomic detail of the cranium and brain with more than 300,000 elements. It has 15 different material properties for brain and surrounding tissues. The model includes viscoelastic gray and white brain matter, membranes, ventricles, cranium and facial bones, soft tissues, and slip interface conditions between the brain and dura. The cranium of the finite element model was loaded by translational and rotational accelerations measured in Hybrid III dummies from 28 laboratory reconstructions of NFL impacts involving 22 concussions. Brain responses were determined using a nonlinear, finite element code to simulate the large deformation response of white and gray matter. Strain responses occurring early (during impact) and mid-late (after impact) were compared with the signs and symptoms of concussion. RESULTS: Strain concentration "hot spots" migrate through the brain with time. In 9 of 22 concussions, the early strain "hot spots" occur in the temporal lobe adjacent to the impact and migrate to the far temporal lobe after head acceleration. In all cases, the largest strains occur later in the fornix, midbrain, and corpus callosum. They significantly correlated with removal from play, cognitive and memory problems, and loss of consciousness. Dizziness correlated with early strain in the orbital-frontal cortex and temporal lobe. The strain migration helps explain coup-contrecoup injuries. CONCLUSION: Finite element modeling showed the largest brain deformations occurred after the primary head acceleration. Midbrain strain correlated with memory and cognitive problems and removal from play after concussion. Concussion injuries happen during the rapid displacement and rotation of the cranium, after peak head acceleration and momentum transfer in helmet impacts.},

However, the relationship between postnatal growth and cortical development remains largely unknown. Therefore, we examined the association between neonatal growth and diffusion tensor imaging measures of microstructural cortical development in infants born very preterm. Participants were 95 neonates born between 24 and 32 weeks gestational age studied twice with diffusion tensor imaging: scan 1 at a median of 32.1 weeks (interquartile range, 30.4 to 33.6) and scan 2 at a median of 40.3 weeks (interquartile range, 38.7 to 42.7). Fractional anisotropy and eigenvalues were recorded from 15 anatomically defined cortical regions. Weight, head circumference, and length were recorded at birth and at the time of each scan. Growth between scans was examined in relation to diffusion tensor imaging measures at scans 1 and 2, accounting for gestational age, birth weight, sex, postmenstrual age, known brain injury (white matter injury, intraventricular hemorrhage, and cerebellar hemorrhage), and neonatal illness (patent ductus arteriosus, days intubated, infection, and necrotizing enterocolitis). Impaired weight, length, and head growth were associated with delayed microstructural development of the cortical gray matter (fractional anisotropy: P {$<$} 0.001), but not white matter (fractional anisotropy: P = 0.529), after accounting for prenatal growth, neonatal illness, and brain injury. Avoiding growth impairment during neonatal care may allow cortical development to proceed optimally and, ultimately, may provide an opportunity to reduce neurological disabilities related to preterm birth.},

  abstract = {Brain abnormality in surviving premature infants is associated with an enormous amount of neurodevelopmental disability, manifested principally by cognitive, behavioral, attentional, and socialization deficits, most commonly with only relatively modest motor deficits. The most recognized contributing neuropathology is cerebral white matter injury. The thesis of this review is that acquired cerebellar abnormality is a relatively less recognized but likely important cause of neurodevelopmental disability in small premature infants. The cerebellar disease may be primarily destructive (eg, hemorrhage, infarction) or primarily underdevelopment. The latter appears to be especially common and relates to a particular vulnerability of the cerebellum of the small premature infant. Central to this vulnerability are the extraordinarily rapid and complex developmental events occurring in the cerebellum. The disturbance of development can be caused either by direct adverse effects on the cerebellum, especially the distinctive transient external granular layer, or by indirect remote trans-synaptic effects. This review describes the fascinating details of cerebellar development, with an emphasis on events in the premature period, the major types of cerebellar abnormality acquired during the premature period, their likely mechanisms of occurrence, and new insights into the relation of cerebellar disease in early life to subsequent cognitive/behavioral/attentional/socialization deficits.},

  abstract = {Preterm birth disrupts the in utero environment, preventing the brain from fully developing, thereby causing later cognitive and behavioral disorders. Such cerebral alteration occurs beneath an anatomical scale, and is therefore undetectable by conventional imagery. Prematurity impairs the microstructure and thus the histological process responsible for the maturation, including the myelination. Cerebral MRI diffusion tensor imaging sequences, based on water's motion into the brain, allows a representation of this maturation process. Similarly, the brain's connections become disorganized. The connectome gathers structural and anatomical white matter fibers, as well as functional networks referring to remote brain regions connected one over another. Structural and functional connectivity is illustrated by tractography and functional MRI, respectively. Their organizations consist of core nodes connected by edges. This basic distribution is already established in the fetal brain. It evolves greatly over time but is compromised by prematurity. Finally, cerebral plasticity is nurtured by a lifetime experience at microstructural and macrostructural scales. A preterm birth causes a negative and early disruption, though it can be partly mitigated by positive stimuli based on developmental neonatal care.},

  abstract = {Understanding the relationship between the structural and functional organization of the human brain is one of the most important goals of neuroscience. Individual variability in brain structure means that it is essential to obtain this information from the same subject. To date, this has been almost impossible. Even though noninvasive functional imaging techniques such as functional MRI (fMRI) are now commonplace, there is no complementary noninvasive structural technique. We present an in vivo method of examining the detailed neuroanatomy of any individual, which can then be correlated with that individual's own functional results. This method utilizes high-resolution structural MRI to identify distinct cortical regions based on cortical lamination structure. We demonstrate that the observed MR lamination patterns relate to myeloarchitecture through a correlation of histology with MRI. In vivo high-resolution MRI studies identify striate cortex, as well as visual area V5, in four individuals, as defined by using fMRI. The anatomical identification of a cortical area (V5MT) outside of striate cortex is a significant advance, proving it possible to identify extra-striate cortical areas and demonstrating that in vivo structural mapping of the human cerebral cortex is possible.},

  abstract = {Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has enabled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of tissue magnetic susceptibility to advance from simple qualitative detection of hypointense blooming artifacts to precise quantitative measurement of spatial biodistributions. QSM technology may be regarded to be sufficiently developed and validated to warrant wide dissemination for clinical applications of imaging isotropic susceptibility, which is dominated by metals in tissue, including iron and calcium. These biometals are highly regulated as vital participants in normal cellular biochemistry, and their dysregulations are manifested in a variety of pathologic processes. Therefore, QSM can be used to assess important tissue functions and disease. To facilitate QSM clinical translation, this review aims to organize pertinent information for implementing a robust automated QSM technique in routine MRI practice and to summarize available knowledge on diseases for which QSM can be used to improve patient care. In brief, QSM can be generated with postprocessing whenever gradient echo MRI is performed. QSM can be useful for diseases that involve neurodegeneration, inflammation, hemorrhage, abnormal oxygen consumption, substantial alterations in highly paramagnetic cellular iron, bone mineralization, or pathologic calcification; and for all disorders in which MRI diagnosis or surveillance requires contrast agent injection. Clinicians may consider integrating QSM into their routine imaging practices by including gradient echo sequences in all relevant MRI protocols. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 5 J.

  abstract = {AbstractThe default mode network (DMN) consists of several regions that selectively interact to support distinct domains of cognition. Of the various sites that partake in DMN function, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), temporal parietal junction (TPJ), and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) are frequently identified as key contributors. Yet, it remains unclear whether these subcomponents of the DMN make unique contributions to specific cognitive processes and health conditions. To address this issue, we applied a meta-analytic parcellation approach used in prior work. This approach used the Neurosynth database and classification methods to quantify the association between PCC, TPJ, and MPFC activation and specific topics related to cognition and health (e.g., decision making and smoking). Our analyses replicated prior observations that the PCC, TPJ, and MPFC collectively support multiple cognitive functions such as decision making, memory, and awareness. To gain insight into the functional organization of each region, we parceled each region based on its coactivation pattern with the rest of the brain. This analysis indicated that each region could be further subdivided into functionally distinct subcomponents. Taken together, we further delineate DMN function by demonstrating the relative strengths of association among subcomponents across a range of cognitive processes and health conditions. A continued attentiveness to the specialization within the DMN allows future work to consider the nuances in sub-regional contributions necessary for healthy cognition, as well as create the potential for more targeted treatment protocols in various health conditions.},

  abstract = {Denoising is critical to improving the quality and stability of cerebral blood flow (CBF) quantification in arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to the intrinsic low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of ASL data. Previous studies have been focused on reducing the spatial or temporal noise using standard filtering techniques, and less attention has been paid to two global nuisance effects, the residual motion artifacts and the global signal fluctuations. Since both nuisances affect the whole brain, removing them in advance should enhance the CBF quantification quality for ASL MRI. The purpose of this paper was to assess this potential benefit. Three methods were proposed to suppress each or both of the two global nuisances. Their performances for CBF quantification were validated using ASL data acquired from 13 subjects. Evaluation results showed that covarying out both global nuisances significantly improved temporal SNR and test-retest stability of CBF measurement. Although the concept of removing both nuisances is not technically novel per se, this paper clearly showed the benefits for ASL CBF quantification. Dissemination of the proposed methods in a free ASL data processing toolbox should be of interest to a broad range of ASL users.},

  abstract = {In MRI, the main magnetic field polarizes the electron cloud of a molecule, generating a chemical shift for observer protons within the molecule and a magnetic susceptibility inhomogeneity field for observer protons outside the molecule. The number of water protons surrounding a molecule for detecting its magnetic susceptibility is vastly greater than the number of protons within the molecule for detecting its chemical shift. However, the study of tissue magnetic susceptibility has been hindered by poor molecular specificities of hitherto used methods based on MRI signal phase and T2* contrast, which depend convolutedly on surrounding susceptibility sources. Deconvolution of the MRI signal phase can determine tissue susceptibility but is challenged by the lack of MRI signal in the background and by the zeroes in the dipole kernel. Recently, physically meaningful regularizations, including the Bayesian approach, have been developed to enable accurate quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) for studying iron distribution, metabolic oxygen consumption, blood degradation, calcification, demyelination, and other pathophysiological susceptibility changes, as well as contrast agent biodistribution in MRI. This paper attempts to summarize the basic physical concepts and essential algorithmic steps in QSM, to describe clinical and technical issues under active development, and to provide references, codes, and testing data for readers interested in QSM.

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks `rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them `small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

  abstract = {Background: Spinal cord injuries (SCI) often result in cardiovascular issues, increasing the risk of stroke and cognitive deficits. Objectives: This study assessed cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a hypercapnic challenge in SCI participants compared to noninjured controls. Methods: Fourteen participants were analyzed (n = 8 with SCI [unless otherwise noted], median age = 44 years; n = 6 controls, median age = 33 years). CVR was calculated through fMRI signal changes. Results: The results showed a longer CVR component (tau) in the grey matter of SCI participants (n = 7) compared to controls (median difference = 3.0 s; p {$<$} .05). Time since injury (TSI) correlated negatively with steady-state CVR in the grey matter and brainstem of SCI participants (RS = -0.81, p = .014; RS = -0.84, p = .009, respectively). Lower steady-state CVR in the brainstem of the SCI group (n = 7) correlated with lower diastolic blood pressure (RS = 0.76, p = .046). Higher frequency of hypotensive episodes (n = 7) was linked to lower CVR outcomes in the grey matter (RS = -0.86, p = .014) and brainstem (RS = -0.89, p = .007). Conclusion: Preliminary findings suggest a difference in the dynamic CVR component, tau, between the SCI and noninjured control groups, potentially explaining the higher cerebrovascular health burden in SCI individuals. Exploratory associations indicate that longer TSI, lower diastolic blood pressure, and more hypotensive episodes may lead to poorer CVR outcomes.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Cervical and upper-thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) commonly results in autonomic cardiovascular impairments. These impairments can lead to alterations in blood flow, cerebral perfusion pressure and ultimately tissue perfusion, which can lead to an elevated risk of stroke and global cognitive deficits. The aim of this study was to assess cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) in both the grey matter (GM) and brainstem using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in participants with SCI compared to non-injured controls. CVR represents the capacity of brain parenchyma to change cerebral blood flow in response to a vasoactive stimulus (e.g. carbon dioxide, CO             2             ) or altered metabolic demand [e.g. neurovascular coupling (NVC)]. Thirteen participants (7 chronic SCI (all male, median age of 42 years), 6 controls (all male, median age of 33 years) were studied cross-sectionally. CVR was measured by assessing the MRI-blood oxygen level--dependent signal with hypercapnic challenge (controlled CO             2             inhalation). The CVR outcome measure was assessed in three ways. Initially, CVR was calculated as is standard, via the linear, least-squares fit across the whole gas challenge protocol (CVR             whole             ). In addition, CVR was further decomposed into its dynamic (tau) and static components (steady state CVR; ssCVR). A 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor was worn to capture free-living blood pressure outcomes. Our results showed a longer tau in the GM of SCI participants compared to controls (median of the difference = 3.0 seconds; p{$<$}0.05). Time since injury (TSI) displayed negative correlations with ssCVR in the GM and brainstem of SCI participants: R             S             =-0.77, p=0.041 and R             S             =-0.76, p=0.049, respectively, where R             S             is the Spearman's rank Correlation Coefficient.

Lower CVR             whole             and ssCVR in the SCI-cohort was significantly (P{$<$}0.05) correlated with lower daytime blood pressure (R             S             {$\geq$} 0.81) and a higher frequency of hypotensive episodes (R             S             {$\geq$} -0.83).

  abstract = {Myelin sensitive MRI techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging and myelin water imaging, have previously been used to reveal changes in myelin after sports-related concussions. What is not clear from these studies, however, is how myelin is affected: whether the it becomes degraded and possibly removed, or whether the myelin sheath loosens and becomes 'decompacted'. Previously, our team revealed myelin specific changes in ice hockey players two weeks post concussion using myelin water imaging. In that study, forty five subjects underwent a pre-season baseline scan, eleven of which sustained a concussion during play and received follow-up scans: eight were scanned within three days, 10 were scanned at 14 days, and nine were scanned at 60 days. In the current retrospective analysis, we used quantitative susceptibility mapping, along with the diffusion tensor imaging measures axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity, to investigate this myelin disruption. If sports-related concussive hits lead to myelin fragmentation in regions of lowered MWF, this should result in a measurable increase in magnetic susceptibility, due to the anisotropic myelin fragmenting into isotropic myelin debris, and the diamagnetic myelin tissue being removed, while no such changes should be expected if the myelin sheath simply loosens and becomes decompacted. An increase in radial diffusivity would likewise reveal myelin fragmentation, as myelin sheaths block water diffusion out of the axon, with little to no changes expected for myelin sheath loosening. Statistical analysis of the same voxels-of-interest that were found to have reduced myelin water fraction two weeks post concussion, revealed no statistically significant changes in magnetic susceptibility, axial diffusivity, or radial diffusivity at any time-point post concussion. This suggests that myelin water fraction changes are likely due to a loosening of the myelin sheath structure, as opposed to fragmentation and removal of myelin debris.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: To study the effect of acute alcohol intoxication on the functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) and temporal fractal properties of the healthy adult brain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven healthy male volunteers were asked to drink 0.59 g/kg of ethanol. Resting state blood oxygen level dependent (rsBOLD) MRI scans were obtained before consumption, 60 min post-consumption and 90 min post-consumption. Before each rsBOLD scan, pointed-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) (1)H-MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) scans were acquired to measure ethanol levels in the right basal ganglia. RESULTS: Significant changes in DMN connectivity were found following alcohol consumption (p {$<$} 0.01). Both increased and decreased regional connectivity were found after 60 min, whereas mostly decreased connectivity was found after 90 min. The fractal behaviour of the rsBOLD signal, which is believed to help reveal complexity of small-scale neuronal circuitry, became more ordered after both 60 and 90 min of alcohol consumption (p {$<$} 0.01). CONCLUSION: The DMN has been linked to personal identity and social behavior. As such, our preliminary findings may provide insight into the neuro-functional underpinnings of the cognitive and behavioral changes observed during acute alcohol intoxication. The reduced fractal dimension implies a change in function of small-scale neural networks towards less complex signaling.},

  abstract = {Background Evidence suggests that obsessive--compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with a dysfunction in the cortico-striatal--thalamic--cortical (CSTC) circuitry. Resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI) allows measurements of resting state networks (RSNs), brain networks that are present at `rest'. However, although OCD has a typical onset during childhood or adolescence, only two other studies have performed rs-fcMRI comparisons of RSNs in children and adolescents with OCD against healthy controls. Methods In the present study, we performed resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging using a 3Tesla MRI, in 11 medication-na\"ive children and adolescents with OCD and 9 healthy controls. In contrast to previous studies that relied on a priori determination of RSNs, we determined resting state functional connectivity with a data-driven independent component analysis (ICA). Results Consistent with previous reports in healthy adults, we identified 13 RSNs. Case--control un-adjusted statistical significance (p{$<$}0.05) was found for two networks. Firstly, increased connectivity (OCD{$>$}control) in the right section of Brodmann area 43 of the auditory network; Secondly, decreased connectivity in the right section of Brodmann area 8 and Brodmann area 40 in the cingulate network. Conclusions Our preliminary findings of case--control differences in RSNs lend further support to the CSTC hypothesis of OCD, as well as implicating other regions of the brain outside of the CSTC.},

Although recent in-vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) studies report gray matter metabolite abnormalities in children and adolescents with OCD, there are no existing 1H-MRS studies that measure white matter (WM) metabolite levels in this population. In the present study, we measured metabolite levels in the left and right prefrontal WM (LPFWM and RPFWM, respectively) of psychotropic-na\"ive children and adolescents with OCD (LPFWM: N{$\frac{1}{4}$} 15, mean age 13.37 2.4 years; right RPFWM: N {$\frac{1}{4}$}14, mean age 13.07 2.3 years) and healthy controls (LPFWM: N{$\frac{1}{4}$} 17, mean age 11.87 2.7 years; RPFWM: N{$\frac{1}{4}$} 18, mean age 12.2 72.8 years). Spectra were acquired using a 3T single voxel PRESS sequence (1.5 \^A 2.0 \^A 2.0 cm3). When age and sex effects were controlled, OCD patients had higher levels of RPFWM choline and N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA). In addition, RPFWM levels of NAA, creatine and myoinositol were positively and significantly correlated with severity of OCD symptoms. In summary, this is the first published study of WM metabolite levels in children and adolescents with OCD. Our preliminary findings lend further support to the previous findings of WM abnormalities in OCD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral venous oxygen saturation can be used as an indirect measure of brain health, yet it often requires either an invasive procedure or a noninvasive technique with poor sensitivity. We aimed to test whether cerebral venous oxygen saturation could be measured using quantitative susceptibility mapping, an MR imaging technique, in 3 distinct groups: healthy term neonates, injured term neonates, and preterm neonates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We acquired multiecho gradient-echo MR imaging data in 16 neonates with perinatal asphyxia and moderate or severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (8 term age: average, 40.0 [SD, 0.8] \,weeks' gestational age; 8 preterm, 33.5 [SD, 2.0] \,weeks' gestational age) and in 8 healthy term-age controls (39.3 [SD, 0.6]\,weeks, for a total of n\,=\,24. Data were postprocessed as quantitative susceptibility mapping images, and magnetic susceptibility was measured in cerebral veins by thesholding out 99.95\% of lower magnetic susceptibility values. RESULTS: The mean magnetic susceptibility value of the cerebral veins was found to be 0.36 (SD, 0.04)\,ppm in healthy term neonates, 0.36 (SD, 0.06)\,ppm in term injured neonates, and 0.29 (SD, 0.04)\,ppm in preterm injured neonates. Correspondingly, the derived cerebral venous oxygen saturation values were 73.6\% (SD, 2.8\%), 71.5\% (SD, 7.4\%), and 72.2\% (SD, 5.9\%). There was no statistically significant difference in cerebral venous oxygen saturation among the 3 groups (P\,=\,.751). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative susceptibility mapping-derived oxygen saturation values in preterm and term neonates agreed well with values in past literature. Cerebral venous oxygen saturation in preterm and term neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, however, was not found to be significantly different between neonates or healthy controls.},

This report describes the development of the Cognition Battery and presents results on test-retest reliability, age effects on performance, and convergent and discriminant construct validity. The NIH-TB Cognition Battery is intended to serve as a brief, convenient set of measures to supplement other outcome measures in epidemiologic and longitudinal research and clinical trials.

While there are numerous algorithms developed to solve this ill-posed inverse problem, estimating susceptibility maps with a wide range of values is still problematic. In cases such as large veins, contrast agent uptake, and intracranial hemorrhages, extreme susceptibility values in focal areas cause severe streaking artifacts. To enable the reduction of these artifacts while preserving subtle susceptibility contrast, a two-level QSM reconstruction algorithm (STAR-QSM) was developed in this study by tuning a regularization parameter to automatically reconstruct both large and small susceptibility values. Compared to current state-of-the-art QSM methods such as iLSQR, STAR-QSM significantly reduced streaking artifacts while preserving sharp boundaries for blood vessels of mouse brains in vivo and fine anatomical details of high resolution mouse brains ex vivo. Brain image data from patients with cerebral hematoma and multiple sclerosis further illustrated the superiority of this method in reducing streaking artifacts caused by large susceptibility sources while maintaining sharp anatomical details. STAR-QSM is implemented in STI Suite, a comprehensive shareware for susceptibility imaging and quantification.},

Understanding the origin of this link is of great interest because it could offer access to a new diagnostic tool for investigating tissue microstructure. Since it has been suggested that myelin is the dominant source of this contrast, creating an accurate model for characterizing the effect of the myelin sheath on the evolution of the NMR signal is an essential step toward fully understanding WM contrast. In this study, we show by comparison of the results of simulations and experiments carried out on human subjects at 7T, that the magnitude and phase of signals acquired from WM in vivo can be accurately characterized by (i) modeling the myelin sheath as a hollow cylinder composed of material having an anisotropic magnetic susceptibility that is described by a tensor with a radially oriented principal axis, and (ii) adopting a two-pool model in which the water in the sheath has a reduced T(2) relaxation time and spin density relative to its surroundings, and also undergoes exchange. The accuracy and intrinsic simplicity of the hollow cylinder model provides a versatile framework for future exploitation of the effect of WM microstructure on gradient echo contrast in clinical MRI.},

The range in geometric mean T2 of the main peak for both white and gray matter was from 70 to 86 ms. T2 distributions from the posterior internal capsules and splenium of the corpus callosum were significantly wider (width is related to water environment inhomogeneity) than those from any other white- or gray-matter structures. Thus, quantitative measurement and analysis of T2 relaxation reveals differences in brain tissue water environments not discernible on conventional MR images.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We investigated the evolution of new multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions over time using frequency shifts of the magnetic resonance (MR) signal. METHODS: Twenty patients with relapsing-remitting MS were serially scanned for 6 months at 1-month intervals. Maps of MR frequency shifts were acquired using susceptibility-weighted imaging. New lesions were identified by enhancement with gadolinium (Gd). RESULTS: Forty new lesions were identified as areas of signal increase on Gd-enhanced scans. Up to 3 months before lesion appearance, the frequency in areas of future Gd enhancement was not detectably different from the frequency in normal-appearing white matter. Rapid increase in MR frequency was observed between 1 month before and 1 month after Gd enhancement. Two months postenhancement and later, the frequency stabilized and remained at a constantly increased level. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that an increase in MR frequency does not simply reflect blood-brain barrier disruption or edema; rather, it reflects a change of tissue architecture as a consequence of new lesion formation. The data demonstrate that the MR frequency of focal MS lesions is increased before the lesions appear on conventional MRI. Unlike many other advanced imaging techniques, the images for frequency mapping can be rapidly acquired at high spatial resolution and standardized on most clinical scanners.},

In particular, mapping of the resonance frequency of the MR signal and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) have been explored for the description of MS lesions. Many current studies utilizing these techniques attribute increases in the MR frequency or QSM to elevated tissue iron content, in addition to myelin loss. However, this common interpretation is inconsistent with recent histopathological studies. Here, we investigate the nature of MR frequency shifts related to MS lesions by comparing post-mortem MRI data with histology, and contrast them with numerical simulations of the MR signal. We demonstrate that iron accumulation is not the driving source of the MR frequency or QSM image contrast in our sample; rather, most chronic MS lesions are characterized by advanced loss of both myelin and iron. Moreover, our results suggest that the appearance of MS lesions on MR frequency maps and QSM depends on changes in the non-lesional white matter surrounding the lesions. Understanding and accounting for these changes is essential for the quantitative interpretation of MR frequency or QSM data in white matter.},

Patients:\enspace{}               Forty-nine infants with median (range) gestational age of 25 (22--30) weeks.                                         Methods:\enspace{}               Amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram/EEG recorded during the first 72{$\quad$}h and analysed over 0--12, 12--24, 24--48 and 48--72{$\quad$}h, for background pattern, sleep--wake cycling, seizures, interburst intervals (IBI) and interburst percentage (IB\%). In total, 2614{$\quad$}h of single-channel EEG examined for seizures. Survivors were assessed at 2{$\quad$}years corrected age with a neurological examination and Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II. Poor outcome was defined as death or survival with neurodevelopmental impairment. Good outcome was defined as survival without impairment.                                         Results:\enspace{}               Thirty infants had good outcome. Poor outcome (n{$\quad$}={$\quad$}19) was associated with depressed aEEG/EEG already during the first 12{$\quad$}h (p{$\quad$}={$\quad$}0.023), and with prolonged IBI and higher IB\% at 24{$\quad$}h. Seizures were present in 43\% of the infants and associated with intraventricular haemorrhages but not with outcome. Best predictors of poor outcome were burst-suppression pattern [76\% correctly predicted; positive predictive value (PPV) 63\%, negative predictive value (NPV) 91\%], IBI{$\quad>\quad$}6{$\quad$}sec (74\% correctly predicted; PPV 67\%, NPV 79\%) and IB\%{$\quad>\quad$}55\% at 24{$\quad$}h age (79\% correctly predicted; PPV 72\%, NPV 80\%). In 35 infants with normal cerebral ultrasound during the first 3{$\quad$}days, outcome was correctly predicted in 82\% by IB\% (PPV 82\%, NPV 83\%).                                         Conclusion:\enspace{}               Long-term outcome can be predicted by aEEG/EEG with 75--80\% accuracy already at 24 postnatal hours in VPT infants, also in infants with no early indication of brain injury.},

In models, the critical state offers a number of computational advantages. Thus this hypothesis, and in particular the experimental work by Beggs and Plenz (2003), has triggered an avalanche of research, with thousands of studies referring to it. Nonetheless, experimental results are still contradictory. How is it possible, that a hypothesis has attracted active research for decades, but nonetheless remains controversial? We discuss the experimental and conceptual controversy, and then present a parsimonious solution that (i) unifies the contradictory experimental results, (ii) avoids disadvantages of a critical state, and (iii) enables rapid, adaptive tuning of network properties to task requirements.},

  abstract = {Fractal processes, like trees or coastlines, are defined by self-similarity or power law scaling controlled by a single exponent, simply related to the fractal dimension or Hurst exponent (H) of the process. Multifractal processes, like turbulence, have more complex behaviours defined by a spectrum of possible local scaling behaviours or singularity exponents (h). Here, we report two experiments that explore the relationships between instrumental and cognitive variables and the monofractal and multifractal parameters of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired in a no-task or resting state. First, we show that the Hurst exponent is greater in grey matter than in white matter regions, and it is maximal in grey matter when data were acquired with an echo time known to optimise BOLD contrast. Second, we show that latency of response in a fame decision/facial encoding task was negatively correlated with the Hurst exponent of resting state data acquired 30 min after task performance. This association was localised to a right inferior frontal cortical region activated by the fame decision task and indicated that people with shorter response latency had more persistent dynamics (higher values of H). Multifractal analysis revealed that faster responding participants had wider singularity spectra of resting fMRI time series in inferior frontal cortex. Endogenous brain oscillations measured by fMRI have monofractal and multifractal properties that can be related to instrumental and cognitive factors in a way, which indicates that these low frequency dynamics are relevant to neurocognitive function.

Thus, iron detection with MRI might provide a biomarker for chronic inflammation within lesions. Here, we examine contributions of iron and myelin to magnetic susceptibility of lesions on quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). METHODS: Fixed MS brain tissue was assessed with MRI including gradient echo data, which was processed to generate field (phase), R2* and QSM. Five lesions were sectioned and evaluated by immunohistochemistry for presence of myelin, iron and microglia/macrophages. Two of the lesions had an elemental analysis for iron concentration mapping, and their phospholipid content was estimated from the difference in the iron and QSM data. RESULTS: Three of the five lesions had substantial iron deposition that was associated with microglia and positive susceptibility values. For the two lesions with elemental analysis, the QSM derived phospholipid content maps were consistent with myelin labeled histology. CONCLUSION: Positive susceptibility values with respect to water indicate the presence of iron in MS lesions, although both demyelination and iron deposition contribute to QSM.},

Exchange between these two pools was demonstrated by a decrease in the steady-state magnetization and relaxation times of 1Hf with radiofrequency irradiation of 1Hr. The pseudo-first-order rate constant for the movement of magnetization from 1Hf to 1Hr was approximately 1 s-1 in kidney and approximately 3 s-1 in skeletal muscle in vivo. Proton NMR imaging demonstrated that this exchange was tissue specific and generated a novel form of NMR image contrast. The extent of exchange between 1Hf and 1Hr as well as the topological correlation of the exchange with relaxation weighted images suggests that this pathway is a major determinant of the observed relaxation properties of water 1H in vivo.},

However, little is known about the specific neuropsychological problems facing these children or their neurological basis. Using prospective longitudinal data from a regional cohort of 92 preterm and 103 full-term children, this study examined relations between term MRI measures of cerebral injury and structural brain development and children's subsequent performance on an object working memory task at the age of 2 years. Results revealed clear between-group differences, with preterm children having greater difficulty encoding new information in working memory than term control children. Within the preterm group, task performance at the age of 2 years was related to both qualitative MRI measures of white matter (WM) injury and quantitative measures of total and regional brain volumes assessed at term equivalent. Bilateral reductions in total tissue volumes (\%region) of the following cerebral regions were specifically related to subsequent working memory performance: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, sensorimotor, parietooccipital and premotor. Associations between total cerebral tissue volumes at term (adjusted and unadjusted for intracranial volume) persisted even after the effects of WM injury were taken into account. This suggests that early disturbance in cerebral development may have an independent adverse impact on later working memory function in the preterm infant. These findings add to our understanding of the neuropathological pathways associated with later executive dysfunction in the very preterm infant.},

This study examined the neuromotor, cognitive, language and emotional/behavioural outcomes of a regional cohort of 4-year-old children born extremely preterm (EPT: 23-27 weeks' gestation), very preterm (VPT: 28-33 weeks) and full term (FT: 38-41 weeks). Of particular interest were children's risks of impairment across multiple neurodevelopmental domains. METHODS: Data were gathered as part of a prospective longitudinal study of 105 very preterm ({$<$} or = 33 weeks gestation) and 107 FT children born during 1998-2000. At 4 years corrected age, children underwent a comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment that included a paediatric neurological examination, cognitive and language testing, and an assessment of child emotional and behavioural adjustment. RESULTS: At age 4 years, compared to FT children, EPT and VPT children had increased risks of cerebral palsy (EPT 18\%, VPT 15\%, FT 1\%), cognitive delay (EPT 33\%, VPT 36\%, FT 13\%), language delay (EPT 29\%, VPT 29\%, FT 10\%) and emotional/behavioural adjustment problems (EPT 37\%, VPT 13\%, FT 11\%). EPT and VPT children were three times more likely to have multiple domain impairments than FT children (EPT 30\%, VPT 29\%, FT 10\%). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of preschool children born very preterm show clinically significant problems in at least one neurodevelopmental domain, with impairment in multiple domains being common. There is a need to monitor preschool development across a range of functional domains and to consider the likely cascading effects of multiple impairments on later development.},

Currently, the diagnosis and management of such injuries are based largely on patient-reported symptoms. An improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of mTBI is urgently needed in order to develop better diagnostic and management protocols. Specifically, dynamic post-injury changes to the myelin sheath in the human brain have not been examined, despite 'compromised white matter integrity' often being described as a consequence of mTBI. In this preliminary cohort study, myelin water imaging was used to prospectively evaluate changes in myelin water fraction, derived from the T2 decay signal, in two varsity hockey teams (45 players) over one season of athletic competition. 11 players sustained a concussion during competition, and were scanned at 72 hours, 2 weeks, and 2 months post-injury. Results demonstrated a reduction in myelin water fraction at 2 weeks post-injury in several brain areas relative to preseason scans, including the splenium of the corpus callosum, right posterior thalamic radiation, left superior corona radiata, left superior longitudinal fasciculus, and left posterior limb of the internal capsule. Myelin water fraction recovered to pre-season values by 2 months post-injury. These results may indicate transient myelin disruption following a single mTBI, with subsequent remyelination of affected neurons. Myelin disruption was not apparent in the athletes who did not experience a concussion, despite exposure to repetitive subconcussive trauma over a season of collegiate hockey. These findings may help to explain many of the metabolic and neurological deficits observed clinically following mTBI.},

Whether advances in perinatal care have altered the incidence of birth asphyxia is unknown. We determined the incidence of birth asphyxia diagnoses made over a 10-year period in California. METHODS: In a population-based retrospective cohort study of 5,364,663 live births, we determined the incidence and case fatality of birth asphyxia between 1991 and 2000. Using a statewide administrative hospital discharge database, we identified all newborn admissions that generated a diagnosis of birth asphyxia (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 768.5, 768.6, or 768.9) or a diagnosis that overlaps with birth asphyxia, such as congenital encephalopathy or fetal distress. We determined incidence and in-hospital case fatality rates adjusted for birth weight and demographic characteristics and stratified by associated perinatal complications. RESULTS: The 24 330 newborns who received a diagnosis of birth asphyxia yielded a population incidence of 4.5 per 1000 live births. Black ethnicity (relative risk [RR]: 1.3; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-1.3), male gender (RR: 1.2; 95\% CI: 1.1-1.2), and low socioeconomic status (RR: 1.2; 95\% CI: 1.1-1.2) all were associated with increased risk. The diagnosis of birth asphyxia decreased by 91\% from 14.8 to 1.3 per 1000 live births during the study years. This decrease could not be explained by an increased diagnosis of overlapping conditions. Overall case fatality was 4\%, and the majority of deaths in infants {$>$}2000 g occurred in the presence of congenital anomalies, cord abnormalities, or maternal hemorrhage. In newborns {$<$}2000 g, case fatality was highest in the presence of chorioamnionitis (48\%). CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of birth asphyxia has decreased dramatically in recent years. The factors that are responsible for this decline are unclear and deserve additional investigation.},

In this article, compressed sensing is used to compensate for the k-space regions where direct filter inversion is unstable. A significantly lower level of streaking artifacts is produced in the resulting susceptibility maps for both simulated and in vivo data sets compared to outcomes obtained using the direct threshold method. It is also demonstrated that the compressed sensing based method outperforms regularization based methods. The key difference between the regularized inversions and compressed sensing compensated inversions is that, in the former case, the entire k-space spectrum estimation is affected by the ill-conditioned filter inversion in certain k-space regions, whereas in the compressed sensing based method only the ill-conditioned k-space regions are estimated. In the susceptibility map calculated from the phase measurement obtained using a 3T scanner, not only are the iron-rich regions well depicted, but good contrast between white and gray matter interfaces that feature a low level of susceptibility variations are also obtained. The correlation between the iron content and the susceptibility levels in iron-rich deep nucleus regions is studied, and strong linear relationships are observed which agree with previous findings.},

However, there are limited studies into E/I imbalance at macroscale and its microcircuit-level mechanisms and clinical associations. In our current work, we computed the Hurst exponent---a previously validated index of the E/I ratio---from resting-state fMRI time series, and simulated microcircuit parameters using biophysical computational models. We found a broad reduction in the Hurst exponent in pharmaco-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), indicative of a shift towards more excitable network dynamics. Connectome decoders pointed to temporolimbic and frontocentral areas as plausible network epicenters of E/I imbalance. Computational simulations further revealed that enhancing cortical excitability in patients likely reflected atypical increases in recurrent connection strength of local neuronal ensembles. Moreover, mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses revealed heightened E/I elevation in patients with longer disease duration, more frequent electroclinical seizures and inter-ictal epileptic spikes, and worse cognitive functioning. Replicated in an independent dataset, our work provides compelling             in-vivo             evidence of a macroscale shift in E/I balance in TLE patients that undergoes progressive changes and underpins cognitive impairments, potentially informing treatment strategies targeting E/I mechanisms.},

A thorough understanding of secondary injury will help to develop effective treatments and improve patient outcome. In this study, the GM model of controlled cortical impact injury (CCII) of Lighthall (1988) was used with modification to induce lateral TBI in rats. Forebrain mitochondria isolated from ipsilateral (IH) and contralateral (CH) hemispheres to impact showed a distinct difference. With glutamate + malate as substrates, mitochondria from the IH showed a significant decrease in State 3 respiratory rates, respiratory control indices (RCI), and P/O ratios. This decrease occurred as early as 1 h and persisted for at least 14 days following TBI. The State 3 respiratory rates, RCI, and P/O ratios could be restored to sham values by the addition of EGTA to the assay mixture. A significant amount of Ca2+ was found to be adsorbed to the mitochondria of both the IH and the CH with higher values seen in the IH. The rate of energy-linked Ca2+ transport in the IH was significantly decreased at 6 and 12 h. These data indicate that CCII-induced TBI perturbs cellular Ca2+ homeostasis and results in excessive Ca2+ adsorption to the mitochondrial membrane, which subsequently inhibits the respiratory chain-linked electron transfer and energy transduction.},

Existing techniques for quantification of CMRO2 with positron emission tomography (PET) or MRI involve special equipment and/or exogenous agents, and may not be suitable for routine clinical studies. In the present study, a noninvasive method is developed to estimate whole-brain CMRO2 in humans. This method applies phase-contrast MRI for quantitative blood flow measurement and T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) MRI for venous oxygenation estimation, and uses the Fick principle of arteriovenous difference for the calculation of CMRO2. Whole-brain averaged CMRO2 values in young, healthy subjects were 132.1 \textpm{} 20.0 {$\mu$}mol/100 g/min, in good agreement with literature reports using PET. Various acquisition strategies for phase-contrast and TRUST MRI were compared, and it was found that nongated phase-contrast and sagittal sinus (SS) TRUST MRI were able to provide the most efficient and accurate estimation of CMRO2. In addition, blood flow and venous oxygenation were found to be positively correlated across subjects. Owing to the noninvasive nature of this method, it may be a convenient and useful approach for assessment of brain metabolism in brain disorders as well as under various physiologic conditions.

To test the model; a phantom of parallel polyethylene filaments was scanned every 15 degrees between 0 degrees and 90 degrees with respect to the system's main magnetic field (B0). The distal radial metaphysis of a healthy female volunteer was scanned in orthogonal projections. The signal from each phantom image and each radial image was separated in a pixel-wise fashion into R2 and R2' maps. As predicted, R2' relaxation showed anisotropic behavior and changed according to sin2 (theta), confirming that columnar structures parallel with B0 will cause no MR susceptibility effects. Scans of the distal radius showed that R2' relaxation was twice as great with the forearm perpendicular to B0 as when it was parallel to it, demonstrating different contributions from struts and columns. For both phantom and radial bone scans, R2 relaxation was isotropic and did not change with object orientation.},

We have developed an approach that analytically describes the NMR signal in the static dephasing regime where diffusion phenomena may be ignored. This approach has been applied to evaluate the NMR signal in the presence of a blood vessel network (with an application to functional imaging), bone marrow (for two specific trabecular structures, asymmetrical and columnar) and a ferrite contrast agent. All investigated systems have some common behavior. If the echo time TE is less than a known characteristic time tc for a given system, then the signal decays exponentially with an argument which depends quadratically on TE. This is equivalent to an R2* relaxation rate which is a linear function of TE. In the opposite case, when TE is greater than tc, the NMR signal follows a simple exponential decay and the relaxation rate does not depend on the echo time. For this time interval, R2* is a linear function of a) volume fraction sigma occupied by the field-creating objects, b) magnetic field Bo or just the objects' magnetic moment for ferrite particles, and c) susceptibility difference delta chi between the objects and the medium.},

MRI was performed and S\emph{{$\nu$}O}\textsubscript{2} was calculated using SWI-MRI data obtained in the straight section of the superior sagittal sinus. Blood perfusion was estimated using PDU and FMBV from the frontal lobe in a mid-sagittal plane of the fetal brain. The association between fetal brain S\emph{{$\nu$}O}\textsubscript{2} and FMBV, and the distribution of S\emph{{$\nu$}O}\textsubscript{2} and FMBV values across gestation were calculated for both groups. \textbf{\emph{Results:}} In growth-restricted fetuses, the brain S\emph{{$\nu$}O}\textsubscript{2} values were similar, and the FMBV values were higher across gestation as compared to normal growth fetuses.

METHODS: Thirty-six pregnant women, having a mean gestational age (GA) of 31 2/7 weeks, underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) data from the foetal brain were acquired. ∆{$\chi$} v of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) was quantified using MR susceptometry from the intra-vascular phase measurements. Assuming the magnetic property of foetal blood, ∆{$\chi$} do , is the same as that of adult blood, S v O 2 was derived from the measured {$\Delta\chi$} v . The variation of ∆{$\chi$} v and S v O 2, as a function of GA, was statistically evaluated. RESULTS: The mean ∆{$\chi$} v in the SSS in the second-trimester (n = 8) and third-trimester foetuses (n = 28) was found to be 0.34\textpm{} 0.06 ppm and 0.49 \textpm 0.05 ppm, respectively. Correspondingly, the derived S v O 2 values were 69.4\% \textpm 3.27\% and 62.6\% \textpm 3.25\%. Although not statistically significant, an increasing trend (p = 0.08) in {$\Delta\chi$} v and a decreasing trend (p = 0.22) in S v O 2 with respect to advancing gestation was observed. CONCLUSION: We report cerebral venous blood magnetic susceptibility and putative oxygen saturation in healthy human foetuses. Cerebral oxygen saturation in healthy human foetuses, despite a slight decreasing trend, does not change significantly with advancing gestation. KEY POINTS: {$\bullet$} Cerebral venous magnetic susceptibility and oxygenation in human foetuses can be quantified. {$\bullet$} Cerebral venous oxygenation was not different between second- and third-trimester foetuses. {$\bullet$} Foetal cerebral venous oxygenation does not change significantly with advancing gestation.},

METHODS: Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) data were acquired from healthy pregnant subjects (n = 21, median = 31.3 weeks, interquartile range = 8.8 weeks). The susceptibility maps were generated from the SWI-phase images using a modified QSM processing pipeline, optimised for fetal applications. The processing pipeline is as follows: (1) mild high-pass filtering followed by quadratic fitting of the phase images to eliminate background phase variations; (2) manual creation of a fetal brain mask that includes the superior sagittal sinus (SSS); (3) inverse filtering of the resultant masked phase images using a truncated k-space approach with geometric constraint. Further, the magnetic susceptibility, ∆{$\chi$}v and corresponding putative SvO2 of the SSS were quantified from the generated susceptibility maps. Systematic error in the measured SvO2 due to the modified pipeline was also studied through simulations. RESULTS: Simulations showed that the systematic error in SvO2 when using a mask that includes a minimum of 5 voxels around the SSS and five slices remains {$<$} 3\% for different orientations of the vessel relative to the main magnetic field. The average ∆{$\chi$}v in the SSS quantified across all gestations was 0.42 \textpm{} 0.03 ppm. Based on ∆{$\chi$}v, the average putative SvO2 in the SSS across all fetuses was 67\% \textpm{} 7\%, which is in good agreement with published studies. CONCLUSIONS: This in vivo study demonstrates the feasibility of using QSM in the human fetal brain to estimate ∆{$\chi$}v and SvO2.

The emergence of scale-free statistics with well-defined exponents has led to the belief that the brain might operate near a critical point. Yet not much is known in terms of how the different exponents arise or how robust they are. Using calcium imaging recordings of dissociated neuronal cultures we show that the exponents are not universal, and that significantly different exponents arise with different culture preparations, leading to the existence of different universality classes. Naturally developing cultures show avalanche statistics consistent with those of a mean-field branching process, however, cultures grown in the presence of folic acid metabolites appear to be in a distinct universality class with significantly different critical exponents. Given the increased synaptic density and number of feedback loops in folate reared cultures, our results suggest that network topology plays a leading role in shaping the avalanche dynamics. We also show that for both types of cultures pronounced correlations exist in the sizes of neuronal avalanches indicating size clustering, being much stronger in folate reared cultures.},

METHODS: Twenty-six AD patients and 25 age-matched healthy controls (HC) were prospectively recruited in this study. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to evaluate cognitive status. We applied the QQ-CCTV algorithm which combines quantitative susceptibility mapping and quantitative blood oxygen level-dependent models (QQ) for OEF calculation. CBF map was computed from arterial spin labeling and CMRO2 was generated based on Fick's principle. Whole-brain and regional OEF, CBF, and CMRO2 analyses were performed. The associations between these measures in substructures of deep brain gray matter and MMSE scores were assessed. RESULTS: Whole brain voxel-wise analysis showed that CBF and CMRO2 values significantly decreased in AD predominantly in the bilateral angular gyrus, precuneus gyrus and parieto-temporal regions. Regional analysis showed that CBF value decreased in the bilateral caudal hippocampus and left rostral hippocampus and CMRO2 value decreased in left caudal and rostral hippocampus in AD patients. Considering all subjects in the AD and HC groups combined, the mean CBF and CMRO2 values in the bilateral hippocampus positively correlated with the MMSE score. CONCLUSION: CMRO2 mapping with the QQ-CCTV method - which is readily available in MR systems for clinical practice - can be a potential biomarker for AD. In addition, CMRO2 in the hippocampus may be a useful tool for monitoring cognitive impairment.},

Increasingly, susceptibility-based contrast is being exploited to investigate brain tissue microstructure and to detect abnormal levels of brain iron as these have been implicated in a variety of neuro-degenerative diseases. However, it remains unclear to what extent magnetic susceptibility-related contrast at high field relates to actual brain iron concentrations. In this study, we performed susceptibility weighted imaging as a function of field strength on healthy brains in vivo and post-mortem brain tissues at 1.5 T, 3 T and 7 T. Iron histology was performed on the tissue samples for comparison. The calculated susceptibility-related parameters R(2)(*) and signal frequency shift in four iron-rich regions (putamen, globus pallidus, caudate, and thalamus) showed an almost linear dependence (r{$>$}or=0.90 for R(2)(*); r{$>$}or=0.83 for phase, p{$<$}0.01) on field strength, suggesting that potential ferritin saturation effects are not relevant to susceptibility-weighted contrast for field strengths up to 7 T. The R(2)(*) dependence on the putative (literature-based) iron concentration was 0.048 Hz/T/ppm. The histological data from brain samples confirmed the linear dependence of R(2)(*) on field strength and showed a slope against iron concentration of 0.0099 Hz/T/ppm dry-weight, which is equivalent to 0.05 Hz/T/ppm wet-weight and closely matched the calculated value in vivo. These results confirm the validity of using susceptibility-weighted contrast as an indicator of iron content in iron-rich brain regions. The absence of saturation effects opens the way to exploit the benefits of MRI at high field strengths for the detection of iron distributions with high sensitivity and resolution.},

  abstract = {Properties of human brain tissue change across the lifespan. Here we model these changes in the living human brain by combining quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of R1 (1/T1) with diffusion MRI and tractography (N=102, ages 7-85). The amount of R1 change during development differs between white-matter fascicles, but in each fascicle the rate of development and decline are mirror-symmetric; the rate of R1 development as the brain approaches maturity predicts the rate of R1 degeneration in aging. Quantitative measurements of macromolecule tissue volume (MTV) confirm that R1 is an accurate index of the growth of new brain tissue. In contrast to R1, diffusion development follows an asymmetric time-course with rapid childhood changes but a slow rate of decline in old age. Together, the time-courses of R1 and diffusion changes demonstrate that multiple biological processes drive changes in white-matter tissue properties over the lifespan.},

We have assessed the dynamics of oligodendrocyte generation and myelination in the human brain. The number of oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum is established in childhood and remains stable after that. Analysis of the integration of nuclear bomb test-derived (14)C revealed that myelin is exchanged at a high rate, whereas the oligodendrocyte population in white matter is remarkably stable in humans, with an annual exchange of 1/300 oligodendrocytes. We conclude that oligodendrocyte turnover contributes minimally to myelin modulation in human white matter and that this instead may be carried out by mature oligodendrocytes, which may facilitate rapid neural plasticity.},

These changes were attributed to variations in the tissue susceptibility. A partial or complete rim of changed susceptibility was detected at the margin of five of the tumors and localized changes were seen within two of the tumors. All five hematomas displayed susceptibility effects. These were seen at the rim of the hematoma in all cases but central effects were also seen in four cases. One area of probable lacunar infarction also displayed susceptibility effects. The effects described may be due to the paramagnetic contribution of species such as deoxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, free ferric iron, hemosiderin, and other breakdown products of blood. Local field inhomogeneities due to changes in tissue susceptibility have implications for magnetic resonance (MR) image interpretation and the performance of MR spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {Measurements of cerebral oxygen consumption (CVO2) may improve our understanding of cerebral oxygenation, but there are few published data for sick neonates. Although cerebral maturation is associated with an increase in cerebral glucose consumption, the relationship between CVO2 and increasing gestational age has not previously been assessed in humans. The aims of this study were to evaluate a noninvasive method for the estimation of CVO2 in the neonate using near infrared spectroscopy, and to investigate the relationship between gestational age and CVO2. Twenty babies who were undergoing intensive care in the neonatal period were studied. Cerebral hemoglobin flow (CHbF) and cerebral venous oxyhemoglobin saturation (CSVO2) were measured using near infrared spectroscopy. Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation was measure by pulse oximetry (SpO2). CVO2 was calculated from the equation: CVO2=CHbF x (SpO2 - SvO2 x 4. The median (range) CVO2 was 0.9 (0.52-1.76) mL x 100 g(-1) min(-1). There was an increase in CVO2 with advancing gestational age (n=20, p=0.55, p=0.014). We conclude that CVO2 can be estimated in sick neonates using noninvasive optical methods. The values obtained are similar to those obtained in other studies by more invasive methods, and are in agreement with values which would be expected from the known rate of cerebral glucose consumption in neonates. Mean (SD) CVO2 at 24-26 wk was 0.5 (0.18) mL x 100 g(-1) min(-1) and rose with increasing gestation to term by 0.03 mL x 100 g(-1) min(-1) per wk.},

Despite the existence of these powerful segmentation methods, the needs of clinical research continue to be fulfilled, to a large extent, using slice-by-slice manual tracing. To bridge the gap between methodological advances and clinical routine, we developed an open source application called ITK-SNAP, which is intended to make level set segmentation easily accessible to a wide range of users, including those with little or no mathematical expertise. This paper describes the methods and software engineering philosophy behind this new tool and provides the results of validation experiments performed in the context of an ongoing child autism neuroimaging study. The validation establishes SNAP intrarater and interrater reliability and overlap error statistics for the caudate nucleus and finds that SNAP is a highly reliable and efficient alternative to manual tracing. Analogous results for lateral ventricle segmentation are provided.},

Seventeen normal, young subjects were scanned using BOLD fMRI while not performing any time-locked experimental behavior. Temporal autocorrelation in these datasets was described well by a 1/frequency relationship. Voxel-wise statistical analysis of these noise datasets which assumed independence (i.e., ignored temporal autocorrelation) rejected the null hypothesis at a higher rate than specified by the nominal {$\alpha$}. Temporal smoothing in conjunction with the use of a modified general linear model (Worsley and Friston, 1995,NeuroImage2: 173--182) brought the false-positive rate closer to the nominal {$\alpha$}. It was also found that the noise fMRI datasets contain spatially coherent time signals. This observed spatial coherence could not be fully explained by a continuously differentiable spatial autocovariance function and was much greater for lower temporal frequencies. Its presence made voxel-wise test statistics in a given noise dataset dependent, and thus shifted their distributions to the right or left of 0. Inclusion of a ``global signal'' covariate in the general linear model reduced this dependence and consequently stabilized (i.e., reduced the variance of) dataset false-positive rates.},

  abstract = {Iron is an essential cofactor for many proteins that are involved in normal neuronal tissue function, but there is increasing evidence that iron accumulation in the brain can cause a vast array of CNS disorders.Global iron homeostasis is regulated at the level of iron absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. This involves a series of molecular interactions between proteins that include the haemochromatosis gene product HFE, transferrin, the transferrin receptor and iron regulatory proteins in the crypts of Lieberk\"uhn.The brain has several characteristics that make it unique with regard to iron metabolism. It resides behind a vascular barrier --- the blood--brain barrier --- which limits its access to plasma iron. Also, the concentration of iron varies considerably between different brain regions: regions that are associated with motor functions tend to have more iron than non-motor-related regions.Iron seems to accumulate in the brain as a function of age. This process is quite specific, and it involves the accumulation of iron-containing molecules in certain cell types, particularly in brain regions that are preferentially targeted in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).PD is associated with increased iron accumulation in the substantia nigra. Proposed mechanisms for iron-induced cell damage in PD include enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species and an increase in oxidative stress and protein aggregation. This includes the aggregation of {$\alpha$}-synuclein, which is one of the main components of Lewy bodies --- one of the pathological hallmarks of PD.In AD, iron accumulation in the brain occurs without the normal age-related increase in ferritin, and this increases the risk of oxidative stress. Iron might also have a direct impact on plaque formation through its effects on amyloid precursor protein processing.Iron accumulation has also been implicated in several other neurological diseases, including congenital aceruloplasminaemia, Friedreich's ataxia, neuroferritinopathy, neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation and restless legs syndrome.Metal chelators are being developed as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PD, AD and other neurodegenerative disorders that involve iron misregulation.If we can understand the timing of iron mismanagement in relation to the progression of neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases and during ageing, this might raise the possibility of monitoring iron changes as a marker of disease progression, and perhaps even pre-clinical diagnosis in conditions where iron mismanagement is an early event.},

  abstract = {Longitudinal brain atlases play an important role in the study of human brain development and cognition. Existing atlases are mainly based on anatomical features derived from T1-and T2-weighted MRI. A 4D developmental quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) atlas may facilitate the estimation of age-related iron changes in deep gray matter nuclei and myelin changes in white matter. To this end, group-wise co-registered QSM templates were generated over various age intervals from age 1--83 years old. Registration was achieved by combining both T1-weighted and QSM images. Based on the proposed template, we created an accurate deep gray matter nuclei parcellation map (DGM map). Notably, we segmented thalamus into 5 sub-regions, i.e. the anterior nuclei, the median nuclei, the lateral nuclei, the pulvinar and the internal medullary lamina. Furthermore, we built a ``whole brain QSM parcellation map'' by combining existing cortical parcellation and white-matter atlases with the proposed DGM map. Based on the proposed QSM atlas, the segmentation accuracy of iron-rich nuclei using QSM is significantly improved, especially for children and adolescent subjects. The age-related progression of magnetic susceptibility in each of the deep gray matter nuclei, the hippocampus, and the amygdala was estimated. Our automated atlas-based analysis provided a systematic confirmation of previous findings on susceptibility progression with age resulting from manual ROI drawings in deep gray matter nuclei. The susceptibility development in the hippocampus and the amygdala follow an iron accumulation model; while in the thalamus sub-regions, the susceptibility development exhibits a variety of trends. It is envisioned that the newly developed 4D QSM atlas will serve as a template for studying brain iron deposition and myelination/demyelination in both normal aging and various brain diseases.},

  abstract = {The human brain rapidly develops during the first two years following birth. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) provides information of iron and myelin variations. It is considered to be a valuable tool for studying brain development in early life. In the present work, QSM is performed on neonates, 1-year and 2-year old infants, as well as a group of adults for the purpose of reference. Age-specific templates representing common brain structures are built for each age group. The neonate and infant QSM templates have shown some unique findings compared to conventional T1w and T2w imaging techniques. The contrast between the gray and white matters on the QSM images did not change through brain development from neonate to adult. A linear correlation was found between brain myelination determined in this study and the microscopic myelin degree determined by a previous autopsy study. Also, the magnetic susceptibility values of the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) exhibit a gradually decreasing trend from birth to 2 years old and to adulthood. The findings suggest that the macromolecular content, myelin, and iron may play the most important contributing factors for the magnetic susceptibility of neonate and infant brain. QSM can be a powerful means to study early brain development and related pathologies that involve alterations in macromolecular content, iron, or brain myelination.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is difficult to distinguish punctate white matter lesions from focal hemorrhagic lesions in neonates on conventional MR imaging because both kinds of lesions show increased signal intensity on T1-weighted images and, frequently, decreased signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Our aim was to distinguish punctate white matter lesions and focal hemorrhagic lesions using quantitative measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the current study, we acquired multiecho gradient recalled-echo MR imaging data from 24 neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and postprocessed them as R2* relaxation maps and quantitative susceptibility maps. Seven subjects who were found to have multifocal punctate white matter lesions and/or focal hemorrhagic lesions on R2* maps were included (mean gestational age at birth, 33 \textpm{} 4.28 weeks; mean gestational age at scanning, 38 \textpm{} 2 weeks). Manually drawing ROIs on R2* maps, we measured R2* and magnetic susceptibility values of the lesions, along with white matter regions within the corpus callosum as healthy comparison tissue. RESULTS: R2* and magnetic susceptibility values were both found to easily distinguish punctate white matter lesions, focal hemorrhagic lesions, and healthy white matter tissue from each other (P {$<$} .05), with a large Hedge g. R2* and magnetic susceptibility values were significantly increased in focal hemorrhagic lesions compared with punctate white matter lesions and healthy white matter tissue. Punctate white matter lesions were also found to have significantly increased values over healthy white matter tissue. CONCLUSIONS: R2* and quantitative susceptibility maps can be used to help clinicians distinguish and measure focal hemorrhages, punctate white matter lesions, and healthy white matter tissue.},

  abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image segmentation.},

  abstract = {Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) is a diffusion model specifically designed for brain magnetic resonance imaging. Despite recent studies suggesting that NODDI modeling might be more sensitive to brain development than diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), these studies were limited to a relatively small age range and mainly based on the manually operated region of interest analysis. Therefore, this study applied NODDI to investigate brain development in a large sample size of 214 subjects ranging in ages from 0 to 14. The whole brain was automatically segmented into 122 regions. The maturation trajectory of each region was characterized by the time course of diffusion metrics and further quantified using nonlinear regression. The NODDI-derived metrics, neurite density index (NDI) and orientation dispersion index (ODI), increased with age. And these two metrics were superior to the DTI-derived metrics in SVM regression models of age. The NDI in white matter exhibited a more rapid growth than that in gray matter (including the cortex and deep nucleus). These diffusion indicators experienced conspicuous increases during early childhood and the growth speed slowed down in adolescence. Region-specific maturation patterns were described throughout the brain, including white matter, cortical and deep gray matter. These development patterns were evaluated and discussed on the basis of NODDI's model assumptions. To summarize, this study verified the high sensitivity of NODDI to age over a crucial developmental period from newborn to adolescence. Moreover, the existing knowledge of brain development has been complemented, suggesting that NODDI has a potential capability in the investigation of brain development.},

These symptoms may be attributable to the degradation of projection fibers associated with the underlying neurodegenerative process. The primary purpose of this study is to find microstructural correlates of impairments across these cognitive domains in PD using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Sixteen patients with PD with comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation and DTI data were retrospectively studied. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were assessed using regions-of-interest (ROI) analysis and confirmed with a voxel-based approach. Executive function directly correlated with FA and inversely correlated with MD in mostly frontal white matter tracts, especially the anterior limb of the internal capsule and genu of the corpus callosum. Likewise, language and attentional performance demonstrated correlations with DTI parameters in the frontal regions, but the attention domain additionally recruited regions widespread throughout the brain, with the most significant correlation identified in cingulate gyrus (cingulum). Lastly, memory impairment mainly involved MD alterations within the fornix. No significant correlations were found between visuospatial skills and DTI measures. Despite some overlap, unique patterns of white matter diffusivity underlie impairments in distinct cognitive domains in patients with PD. DTI combined with neurocognitive tests may be a valuable biomarker for identifying cognitive impairments in PD.},

In this study, phase imaging in the neonatal brain is demonstrated for the first time. Compared to adults, phase differences between gray and white matter are significantly reduced but not inverted in neonates with little myelination and iron deposits in their brains. The remaining phase difference between the neonatal and adult brains may be due to a different macromolecule concentration in the unmyelinated brain of the neonates and thus a different frequency due to water macromolecule exchange. Additionally, the susceptibility contrast from brain myelination can be separately studied in neonates during brain development. Therefore, magnetic resonance phase imaging is suggested as a novel tool to study neonatal brain development and pathologies in neonates.},

  abstract = {Preterm birth (PTB) is defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation. Globally, 15 million infants are born prematurely, putting these children at an increased risk of mortality and lifelong health challenges. Currently in the U.S., there is only one FDA approved therapy for the prevention of preterm birth. Makena is an intramuscular progestin injection given to women who have experienced a premature delivery in the past. Recently, however, Makena failed a confirmatory trial, resulting the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research's (CDER) recommendation for the FDA to withdrawal Makena's approval. This recommendation would leave clinicians with no therapeutic options for preventing PTB. Here, we outline recent interdisciplinary efforts involving physicians, pharmacologists, biologists, chemists, and engineers to understand risk factors associated with PTB, mechanisms that contribute to PTB, and to develop next generation therapies for preventing PTB. These advances have the potential to better identify women at risk for PTB, prevent the onset of premature labor, and, ultimately, save infant lives.,},

  abstract = {The development of automated tools for brain morphometric analysis in infants has lagged significantly behind analogous tools for adults. This gap reflects the greater challenges in this domain due to: 1) a smaller-scaled region of interest, 2) increased motion corruption, 3) regional changes in geometry due to heterochronous growth, and 4) regional variations in contrast properties corresponding to ongoing myelination and other maturation processes. Nevertheless, there is a great need for automated image-processing tools to quantify differences between infant groups and other individuals, because aberrant cortical morphologic measurements (including volume, thickness, surface area, and curvature) have been associated with neuropsychiatric, neurologic, and developmental disorders in children. In this paper we present an automated segmentation and surface extraction pipeline designed to accommodate clinical MRI studies of infant brains in a population 0-2 year-olds. The algorithm relies on a single channel of T1-weighted MR images to achieve automated segmentation of cortical and subcortical brain areas, producing volumes of subcortical structures and surface models of the cerebral cortex. We evaluated the algorithm both qualitatively and quantitatively using manually labeled datasets, relevant comparator software solutions cited in the literature, and expert evaluations. The computational tools and atlases described in this paper will be distributed to the research community as part of the FreeSurfer image analysis package.},
