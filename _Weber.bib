  abstract = {Background: Temporal fractals are characterized by prominent scale-invariance and self-similarity across time scales. Monofractal analysis quantifies this scaling behavior in a single parameter, the Hurst exponent (H). Higher H reflects greater correlation in the signal structure, which is taken as being more fractal. Previous fMRI studies have observed lower H during conventional tasks relative to resting state conditions, and shown that H is negatively correlated with task difficulty and novelty. To date, no study has investigated the fractal dynamics of BOLD signal during naturalistic conditions. Methods: We performed fractal analysis on Human Connectome Project 7T fMRI data (n = 72, 41 females, mean age 29.46 {\textpm} 3.76 years) to compare H across movie-watching and rest. Results: In contrast to previous work using conventional tasks, we found higher H values for movie relative to rest (mean difference = 0.014; p = 5.279 {\texttimes} 10-7; 95\% CI [0.009, 0.019]). H was significantly higher in movie than rest in the visual, somatomotor and dorsal attention networks, but was significantly lower during movie in the frontoparietal and default networks. We found no cross-condition differences in test-retest reliability of H. Finally, we found that H of movie-derived stimulus properties (e.g., luminance changes) were fractal whereas H of head motion estimates were non-fractal. Conclusions: Overall, our findings suggest that movie-watching induces fractal signal dynamics. In line with recent work characterizing connectivity-based brain state dynamics during movie-watching, we speculate that these fractal dynamics reflect the configuring and reconfiguring of brain states that occurs during naturalistic processing, and are markedly different than dynamics observed during conventional tasks.},

  abstract = {The following review will aid readers in providing an overview of scale-free dynamics and monofractal analysis, as well as its applications and potential in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neuroscience and clinical research. Like natural phenomena such as the growth of a tree or crashing ocean waves, the brain expresses scale-invariant, or fractal, patterns in neural signals that can be measured. While neural phenomena may represent both monofractal and multifractal processes and can be quantified with many different interrelated parameters, this review will focus on monofractal analysis using the Hurst exponent (H). Monofractal analysis of fMRI data is an advanced analysis technique that measures the complexity of brain signaling by quantifying its degree of scale-invariance. As such, the H value of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal specifies how the degree of correlation in the signal may mediate brain functions. This review presents a brief overview of the theory of fMRI monofractal analysis followed by notable findings in the field. Through highlighting the advantages and challenges of the technique, the article provides insight into how to best conduct fMRI fractal analysis and properly interpret the findings with physiological relevance. Furthermore, we identify the future directions necessary for its progression towards impactful functional neuroscience discoveries and widespread clinical use. Ultimately, this presenting review aims to build a foundation of knowledge among readers to facilitate greater understanding, discussion, and use of this unique yet powerful imaging analysis technique.},

  abstract = {Background               The SARS-CoV-2 virus has impacted life in many ways, one change being the use of face masks. Their effect on MRI-based measurements of cerebral oxygen levels with quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) is not known.                                         Purpose               This study investigated whether wearing a face mask leads to changes in CBF and cerebral venous oxygen saturation measured with MRI.                                         Study Type               Repeated-measures cohort study.                                         Population               A total of 16 healthy volunteers (eight male, eight female; 22--36\,years) were recruited for the 3-ply study. Ten of the 16 participants (five male, five female; 23--36\,years) took part in the KN95 study.                                         Field Strength/Sequence               A 3\,T, single-delay 3D gradient-and spin-echo pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) scan for CBF quantification, and gradient-echo for QSM and oxygenation quantification.                                         Assessment                                Gray matter CBF and magnetic susceptibility were assessed by masking the pCASL CBF map and the QSM map to the T                 1                 -weighted gray matter tissue segmentation. Venous oxygenation was determined from venous segmentation of QSM maximum intensity projections.                                                        Statistical Tests                                Paired Student's                 t                 -tests and Cohen's d effect sizes were used to compare the face mask and no face mask scans for gray matter CBF, gray matter magnetic susceptibility, and cerebral venous oxygen saturation. Standard                 t                 -tests were used to assess whether the order of scanning with and without a mask had any impact. A statistical cut off of                 P                 ~{$<$}\,0.05 was used.                                                        Results                                The 3-ply masks increased gray matter CBF from an average of 43.99\,mL/(100\,g*min) to 46.81\,mL/(100\,g*min). There were no significant changes in gray matter magnetic susceptibility (                 P                 ~=~0.07), or cerebral venous oxygen saturation (                 P                 ~=~0.36) for the 3-ply data set. The KN95 masks data set showed no statistically significant changes in gray matter CBF (                 P                 ~=~0.52) and magnetic susceptibility (                 P                 ~=~0.97), or cerebral venous oxygen saturation (                 P                 ~=~0.93).                                                        Data Conclusion               The changes in blood flow and oxygenation due to face masks are small. Only CBF increased significantly due to wearing a 3-ply mask.

  abstract = {The cause of Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) is unknown, but neuroimaging evidence suggests that DCD may be related to altered brain development. Children with DCD show less structural and functional connectivity compared to typically developing (TD) children, but few studies have examined cortical volume in children with DCD. The purpose of this study was to investigate cortical grey matter volume using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in children with DCD compared to TD children. Methods: This cross-sectional study was part of a larger randomized-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02597751) that involved various MRI scans of children with/without DCD. This paper focuses on the anatomical scans, performing VBM of cortical grey matter volume in 30 children with DCD and 12 TD children. Preprocessing and VBM data analysis were conducted using the Computational Anatomy Tool Box-12 and a study-specific brain template. Differences between DCD and TD groups were assessed using a one-way ANOVA, controlling for total intracranial volume. Regression analyses examined if motor and/or attentional difficulties predicted grey matter volume. We used threshold-free cluster enhancement (5000 permutations) and set an alpha level of 0.05. Due to the small sample size, we did not correct for multiple comparisons. Results: Compared to the TD group, children with DCD had significantly greater grey matter in the left superior frontal gyrus. Lower motor scores (meaning greater impairment) were related to greater grey matter volume in left superior frontal gyrus, frontal pole, and right middle frontal gyrus. Greater grey matter volume was also significantly correlated with higher scores on the Conners 3 ADHD Index in the left superior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobe, and precuneus. These results indicate that greater grey matter volume in these regions is associated with poorer motor and attentional skills. Discussion: Greater grey matter volume in the left superior frontal gyrus in children with DCD may be a result of delayed or absent healthy cortical thinning, potentially due to altered synaptic pruning as seen in other neurodevelopmental disorders. These findings provide further support for the hypothesis that DCD is related to altered brain development.},

Methods: This study is part of a randomized waitlist-control trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02597751). Children with DCD (N=78) were randomized to either a treatment or waitlist group and underwent three MRIs over six months. The treatment group received intervention (once weekly for 10 weeks) between the first and second scan; the waitlist group received intervention between the second and third scan. Cortical grey matter volume was measured using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Behavioral outcome measures included the Performance Quality Rating Scale (PQRS) and Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-2 (BOT-2). Of the 78 children, 58 were excluded (mostly due to insufficient data quality), leaving a final N=20 for analyses. Due to the small sample size, we combined both groups to examine treatment effects. Cortical grey matter volume differences were assessed using a repeated measures ANOVA, controlling for total intracranial volume. Regression analyses examined the relationship of grey matter volume changes to BOT-2 (motor performance) and PQRS (movement quality). Results: After CO-OP, children had significantly decreased grey matter in the right superior frontal gyrus and middle/posterior cingulate gyri. We found no significant associations of grey matter volume changes with PQRS or BOT-2 scores. Conclusion: Decreased cortical grey matter volume generally reflects greater brain maturity. Decreases in grey matter volume after CO-OP intervention were in regions associated with self-regulation and motor control, consistent with our other studies. Decreased grey matter volume may be due to focal increases in synaptic pruning, perhaps as a result of strengthening networks in the brain via the repeated learning and actions in therapy. Findings from this study add to the growing body of literature demonstrating positive neuroplastic changes in the brain after CO-OP intervention.},

  abstract = {Current evidence suggests that iron deficiency (ID) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of conditions presenting with restlessness such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and restless legs syndrome (RLS). In clinical practice, ID and iron supplementation are not routinely considered in the diagnostic work-up and/or as a treatment option in such conditions. Therefore, we conducted a scoping literature review of ID guidelines. Of the 58 guidelines included, only 9 included RLS, and 3 included ADHD. Ferritin was the most frequently cited biomarker, though cutoff values varied between guidelines and depending on additional factors such as age, sex, and comorbidities. Recommendations surrounding measurable iron biomarkers and cutoff values varied between guidelines; moreover, despite capturing the role of inflammation as a concept, most guidelines often did not include recommendations for how to assess this. This lack of harmonization on the interpretation of iron and inflammation biomarkers raises questions about the applicability of current guidelines in clinical practice. Further, the majority of ID guidelines in this review did not include the ID-associated disorders, ADHD and RLS. As ID can be associated with altered movement patterns, a novel consensus is needed for investigating and interpreting iron status in the context of different clinical phenotypes.},

We calculated the Hurst exponent (H) - a measure of temporal complexity - from resting state functional magnetic resonance signal in preterm and term born infants. Anatomical, fMRI, and diffusion weighted imaging data from 716 neonates born between 23-43 weeks gestational age were obtained from the Developing Human Connectome Project. H was assessed in brain tissues and 13 resting state networks. H significantly increased with age, and earlier birth age contributed to lower H values. In most brain regions, H begins below 0.5 at preterm age and crosses 0.5 at term age. Motor and sensory networks demonstrated the greatest increase in H. Correlations between indirect measures of myelination and H were moderate. Overall, H appears to reflect developmental processes in the neonatal brain, as BOLD signal in the preterm infant transforms from anticorrelated to correlated but is reduced compared to term born infants.},

  abstract = {Background: Spinal cord injuries (SCI) often result in cardiovascular issues, increasing the risk of stroke and cognitive deficits. Objectives: This study assessed cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a hypercapnic challenge in SCI participants compared to noninjured controls. Methods: Fourteen participants were analyzed (n = 8 with SCI [unless otherwise noted], median age = 44 years; n = 6 controls, median age = 33 years). CVR was calculated through fMRI signal changes. Results: The results showed a longer CVR component (tau) in the grey matter of SCI participants (n = 7) compared to controls (median difference = 3.0 s; p {$<$} .05). Time since injury (TSI) correlated negatively with steady-state CVR in the grey matter and brainstem of SCI participants (RS = -0.81, p = .014; RS = -0.84, p = .009, respectively). Lower steady-state CVR in the brainstem of the SCI group (n = 7) correlated with lower diastolic blood pressure (RS = 0.76, p = .046). Higher frequency of hypotensive episodes (n = 7) was linked to lower CVR outcomes in the grey matter (RS = -0.86, p = .014) and brainstem (RS = -0.89, p = .007). Conclusion: Preliminary findings suggest a difference in the dynamic CVR component, tau, between the SCI and noninjured control groups, potentially explaining the higher cerebrovascular health burden in SCI individuals. Exploratory associations indicate that longer TSI, lower diastolic blood pressure, and more hypotensive episodes may lead to poorer CVR outcomes.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Cervical and upper-thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) commonly results in autonomic cardiovascular impairments. These impairments can lead to alterations in blood flow, cerebral perfusion pressure and ultimately tissue perfusion, which can lead to an elevated risk of stroke and global cognitive deficits. The aim of this study was to assess cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) in both the grey matter (GM) and brainstem using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in participants with SCI compared to non-injured controls. CVR represents the capacity of brain parenchyma to change cerebral blood flow in response to a vasoactive stimulus (e.g. carbon dioxide, CO             2             ) or altered metabolic demand [e.g. neurovascular coupling (NVC)]. Thirteen participants (7 chronic SCI (all male, median age of 42 years), 6 controls (all male, median age of 33 years) were studied cross-sectionally. CVR was measured by assessing the MRI-blood oxygen level--dependent signal with hypercapnic challenge (controlled CO             2             inhalation). The CVR outcome measure was assessed in three ways. Initially, CVR was calculated as is standard, via the linear, least-squares fit across the whole gas challenge protocol (CVR             whole             ). In addition, CVR was further decomposed into its dynamic (tau) and static components (steady state CVR; ssCVR). A 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor was worn to capture free-living blood pressure outcomes. Our results showed a longer tau in the GM of SCI participants compared to controls (median of the difference = 3.0 seconds; p{$<$}0.05). Time since injury (TSI) displayed negative correlations with ssCVR in the GM and brainstem of SCI participants: R             S             =-0.77, p=0.041 and R             S             =-0.76, p=0.049, respectively, where R             S             is the Spearman's rank Correlation Coefficient. Neurological level of injury (NLI), modified into an ascending, continuous numeric variable, was positively correlated with GM CVR             whole             (R             S             =0.85, p=0.016), GM ssCVR (R             S             =0.95, p=0.001) and brainstem ssCVR (R             S             =0.90, p=0.006). Lower CVR             whole             and ssCVR in the SCI-cohort was significantly (P{$<$}0.05) correlated with lower daytime blood pressure (R             S             {$\geq$} 0.81) and a higher frequency of hypotensive episodes (R             S             {$\geq$} -0.83). Thus, living with a SCI for a longer period of time, having a higher NLI and lower blood pressure are linked with poorer CVR outcomes. Our preliminary findings reveal an important difference between the cohorts in the dynamic CVR component, tau. Collectively, these results may partially explain the increased cerebrovascular health burden in individuals with SCI.                                   Highlights                                             CVR is the change in blood flow in response to a vasodilatory stimulus (e.g., hypercapnia).                                               Impaired CVR is linked with increased stroke risk and cognitive deficits.                                               We investigated the dynamic and steady-state components of CVR using fMRI in individuals with a SCI.                                               The dynamic component was significantly different compared to non-injured controls.                                               CVR is significantly correlated with time since injury, level of injury and ambulatory daytime blood pressure.},

  abstract = {Myelin sensitive MRI techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging and myelin water imaging, have previously been used to reveal changes in myelin after sports-related concussions. What is not clear from these studies, however, is how myelin is affected: whether the it becomes degraded and possibly removed, or whether the myelin sheath loosens and becomes 'decompacted'. Previously, our team revealed myelin specific changes in ice hockey players two weeks post concussion using myelin water imaging. In that study, forty five subjects underwent a pre-season baseline scan, eleven of which sustained a concussion during play and received follow-up scans: eight were scanned within three days, 10 were scanned at 14 days, and nine were scanned at 60 days. In the current retrospective analysis, we used quantitative susceptibility mapping, along with the diffusion tensor imaging measures axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity, to investigate this myelin disruption. If sports-related concussive hits lead to myelin fragmentation in regions of lowered MWF, this should result in a measurable increase in magnetic susceptibility, due to the anisotropic myelin fragmenting into isotropic myelin debris, and the diamagnetic myelin tissue being removed, while no such changes should be expected if the myelin sheath simply loosens and becomes decompacted. An increase in radial diffusivity would likewise reveal myelin fragmentation, as myelin sheaths block water diffusion out of the axon, with little to no changes expected for myelin sheath loosening. Statistical analysis of the same voxels-of-interest that were found to have reduced myelin water fraction two weeks post concussion, revealed no statistically significant changes in magnetic susceptibility, axial diffusivity, or radial diffusivity at any time-point post concussion. This suggests that myelin water fraction changes are likely due to a loosening of the myelin sheath structure, as opposed to fragmentation and removal of myelin debris.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: To study the effect of acute alcohol intoxication on the functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) and temporal fractal properties of the healthy adult brain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven healthy male volunteers were asked to drink 0.59 g/kg of ethanol. Resting state blood oxygen level dependent (rsBOLD) MRI scans were obtained before consumption, 60 min post-consumption and 90 min post-consumption. Before each rsBOLD scan, pointed-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) (1)H-MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) scans were acquired to measure ethanol levels in the right basal ganglia. RESULTS: Significant changes in DMN connectivity were found following alcohol consumption (p {$<$} 0.01). Both increased and decreased regional connectivity were found after 60 min, whereas mostly decreased connectivity was found after 90 min. The fractal behaviour of the rsBOLD signal, which is believed to help reveal complexity of small-scale neuronal circuitry, became more ordered after both 60 and 90 min of alcohol consumption (p {$<$} 0.01). CONCLUSION: The DMN has been linked to personal identity and social behavior. As such, our preliminary findings may provide insight into the neuro-functional underpinnings of the cognitive and behavioral changes observed during acute alcohol intoxication. The reduced fractal dimension implies a change in function of small-scale neural networks towards less complex signaling.},

  abstract = {Background Evidence suggests that obsessive--compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with a dysfunction in the cortico-striatal--thalamic--cortical (CSTC) circuitry. Resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI) allows measurements of resting state networks (RSNs), brain networks that are present at `rest'. However, although OCD has a typical onset during childhood or adolescence, only two other studies have performed rs-fcMRI comparisons of RSNs in children and adolescents with OCD against healthy controls. Methods In the present study, we performed resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging using a 3Tesla MRI, in 11 medication-na{\"i}ve children and adolescents with OCD and 9 healthy controls. In contrast to previous studies that relied on a priori determination of RSNs, we determined resting state functional connectivity with a data-driven independent component analysis (ICA). Results Consistent with previous reports in healthy adults, we identified 13 RSNs. Case--control un-adjusted statistical significance (p{$<$}0.05) was found for two networks. Firstly, increased connectivity (OCD{$>$}control) in the right section of Brodmann area 43 of the auditory network; Secondly, decreased connectivity in the right section of Brodmann area 8 and Brodmann area 40 in the cingulate network. Conclusions Our preliminary findings of case--control differences in RSNs lend further support to the CSTC hypothesis of OCD, as well as implicating other regions of the brain outside of the CSTC.},

  abstract = {Obsessive--compulsive disorder (OCD) has a typical onset during childhood or adolescence. Although recent in-vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) studies report gray matter metabolite abnormalities in children and adolescents with OCD, there are no existing 1H-MRS studies that measure white matter (WM) metabolite levels in this population. In the present study, we measured metabolite levels in the left and right prefrontal WM (LPFWM and RPFWM, respectively) of psychotropic-na{\"i}ve children and adolescents with OCD (LPFWM: N{$\frac{1}{4}$} 15, mean age 13.37 2.4 years; right RPFWM: N {$\frac{1}{4}$}14, mean age 13.07 2.3 years) and healthy controls (LPFWM: N{$\frac{1}{4}$} 17, mean age 11.87 2.7 years; RPFWM: N{$\frac{1}{4}$} 18, mean age 12.2 72.8 years). Spectra were acquired using a 3T single voxel PRESS sequence (1.5 {\^A} 2.0 {\^A} 2.0 cm3). When age and sex effects were controlled, OCD patients had higher levels of RPFWM choline and N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA). In addition, RPFWM levels of NAA, creatine and myoinositol were positively and significantly correlated with severity of OCD symptoms. In summary, this is the first published study of WM metabolite levels in children and adolescents with OCD. Our preliminary findings lend further support to the previous findings of WM abnormalities in OCD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is difficult to distinguish punctate white matter lesions from focal hemorrhagic lesions in neonates on conventional MR imaging because both kinds of lesions show increased signal intensity on T1-weighted images and, frequently, decreased signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Our aim was to distinguish punctate white matter lesions and focal hemorrhagic lesions using quantitative measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the current study, we acquired multiecho gradient recalled-echo MR imaging data from 24 neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and postprocessed them as R2* relaxation maps and quantitative susceptibility maps. Seven subjects who were found to have multifocal punctate white matter lesions and/or focal hemorrhagic lesions on R2* maps were included (mean gestational age at birth, 33 {\textpm} 4.28 weeks; mean gestational age at scanning, 38 {\textpm} 2 weeks). Manually drawing ROIs on R2* maps, we measured R2* and magnetic susceptibility values of the lesions, along with white matter regions within the corpus callosum as healthy comparison tissue. RESULTS: R2* and magnetic susceptibility values were both found to easily distinguish punctate white matter lesions, focal hemorrhagic lesions, and healthy white matter tissue from each other (P {$<$} .05), with a large Hedge g. R2* and magnetic susceptibility values were significantly increased in focal hemorrhagic lesions compared with punctate white matter lesions and healthy white matter tissue. Punctate white matter lesions were also found to have significantly increased values over healthy white matter tissue. CONCLUSIONS: R2* and quantitative susceptibility maps can be used to help clinicians distinguish and measure focal hemorrhages, punctate white matter lesions, and healthy white matter tissue.},
