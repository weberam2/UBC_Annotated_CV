We found that, with physiological Ca2+ gradients, the hierarchy was CaV2.2>CaV1>CaV3. Mathematical modeling predicts that the CaV2.2 Ca2+ nanodomain, which is ∼25% more extensive than that generated by CaV1, can activate a calcium-fusion sensor located on the proximal face of the synaptic vesicle.",

However, although OCD has a typical onset during childhood or adolescence, only two other studies have performed rs-fcMRI comparisons of RSNs in children and adolescents with OCD against healthy controls.In the present study, we performed resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging using a 3 Tesla MRI, in 11 medication-naïve children and adolescents with OCD and 9 healthy controls.

Compared with standard histogram‐based analyses, angle‐resolved analysis of R2* has previously been shown to substantially improve the detection of subtle differences in the brain between healthy siblings of subjects with multiple sclerosis and unrelated healthy controls. Neonates, who are born with very little myelin and iron, and an underdeveloped connectome, provide researchers with an opportunity to investigate whether R2* is intimately linked with fibre‐angle or myelin content as it is in adults, which may in future studies be explored as a potential white matter developmental biomarker. Five healthy adult volunteers (mean age [±SD] = 31.2 [±8.3] years; three males) were recruited from Vancouver, Canada.

Like natural phenomena such as the growth of a tree or crashing ocean waves, the brain expresses scale‐invariant, or fractal, patterns in neural signals that can be measured. While neural phenomena may represent both monofractal and multifractal processes and can be quantified with many different interrelated parameters, this review will focus on monofractal analysis using the Hurst exponent (H). Monofractal analysis of fMRI data is an advanced analysis technique that measures the complexity of brain signaling by quantifying its degree of scale‐invariance. As such, the H value of the blood oxygenation level‐dependent (BOLD) signal specifies how the degree of correlation …",

                "abstract": "Myelin sensitive MRI techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging and myelin water imaging, have previously been used to reveal changes in myelin after sports-related concussions. What is not clear from these studies, however, is how myelin is affected: whether it becomes degraded and possibly removed, or whether the myelin sheath loosens and becomes “decompacted”. Previously, our team revealed myelin specific changes in ice hockey players 2 weeks post-concussion using myelin water imaging. In that study, 45 subjects underwent a pre-season baseline scan, 11 of which sustained a concussion during play and received follow-up scans: eight were scanned within 3 days, 10 were scanned at 14 days, and nine were scanned at 60 days. In the current retrospective analysis, we used quantitative susceptibility mapping, along with the diffusion tensor imaging measures axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity, to investigate this myelin disruption. If sports-related concussive hits lead to myelin fragmentation in regions of lowered MWF, this should result in a measurable increase in magnetic susceptibility, due to the anisotropic myelin fragmenting into isotropic myelin debris, and the diamagnetic myelin tissue being removed, while no such changes should be expected if the myelin sheath simply loosens and becomes decompacted. An increase in radial diffusivity would likewise reveal myelin fragmentation, as myelin sheaths block water diffusion out of the axon, with little to no changes expected for myelin sheath loosening. Statistical analysis of the same voxels-of-interest that were found to have reduced myelin water fraction 2 weeks post …",

In previous studies, orientation effects of R2 relaxation in the mature brain's white matter have been found to be described by a susceptibility-based model of diffusion through local magnetic field inhomogeneities created by the diamagnetic myelin sheaths. Orientation effects in human newborn white matter have not yet been investigated. The newborn brain is known to contain very little myelin and is therefore expected to exhibit a decrease in orientation dependence driven by susceptibility-based effects.

Monofractal analysis quantifies this scaling behavior in a single parameter, the Hurst exponent (H). Higher H reflects greater correlation in the signal structure, which is taken as being more fractal. Previous fMRI studies have observed lower H during conventional tasks relative to resting state conditions, and shown that H is negatively correlated with task difficulty and novelty. To date, no study has investigated the fractal dynamics of BOLD signal during naturalistic conditions.Methods: We performed fractal analysis on Human Connectome Project 7T fMRI data (n = 72, 41 females, mean age 29.46 ± 3.76 years) to compare H across movie-watching and rest.Results: In contrast to previous work using conventional tasks, we found higher H values for movie relative to rest (mean difference = 0.014; p = 5.279 × 10−7; 95% CI [0.009, 0.019]). H was significantly higher in movie than rest in the visual, somatomotor and dorsal attention networks, but was significantly lower during movie in the frontoparietal and default networks. We found no cross-condition differences in test-retest reliability of H. Finally, we found that H of movie-derived stimulus properties (e.g., luminance changes) were fractal whereas H of head motion estimates were non-fractal.Conclusions: Overall, our findings suggest that movie-watching induces fractal signal dynamics. In line with recent work characterizing connectivity-based brain state dynamics during movie-watching, we speculate that these fractal dynamics reflect the configuring and reconfiguring of brain states …",

This finding prompted us to retest whether PDLIM5 is a component of a molecular complex with CaV2. 2 by biochemical and immunocytochemical analysis.

In clinical practice, ID and iron supplementation are not routinely considered in the diagnostic work-up and/or as a treatment option in such conditions. Therefore, we conducted a scoping literature review of ID guidelines. Of the 58 guidelines included, only 9 included RLS, and 3 included ADHD. Ferritin was the most frequently cited biomarker, though cutoff values varied between guidelines and depending on additional factors such as age, sex, and comorbidities. Recommendations surrounding measurable iron biomarkers and cutoff values varied between guidelines; moreover, despite capturing the role of inflammation as a concept, most guidelines often did not include recommendations for how to assess this. This lack of harmonization on the interpretation of iron and inflammation biomarkers raises questions about the applicability of current guidelines in clinical practice. Further, the majority of ID guidelines in this review did not include the ID-associated disorders, ADHD and RLS. As ID can be associated with altered movement patterns, a novel consensus is needed for investigating and interpreting iron status in the context of different clinical phenotypes.",

Children with DCD show less structural and functional connectivity compared to typically developing (TD) children, but few studies have examined cortical volume in children with DCD. The purpose of this study was to investigate cortical grey matter volume using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in children with DCD compared to TD children.This cross-sectional study was part of a larger randomized-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02597751) that involved various MRI scans of children with/without DCD. This paper focuses on the anatomical scans, performing VBM of cortical grey matter volume in 30 children with DCD and 12 TD children. Preprocessing and VBM data analysis were conducted using the Computational Anatomy Tool Box-12 and a study-specific brain template. Differences between DCD and TD groups were assessed using a one-way ANOVA, controlling for total intracranial volume. Regression analyses examined if motor and/or attentional difficulties predicted grey matter volume. We used threshold-free cluster enhancement (5,000 permutations) and set an alpha level of 0.05. Due to the small sample size, we did not correct for multiple comparisons.Compared to the TD group, children with DCD had significantly greater grey matter in the left superior frontal gyrus. Lower motor scores (meaning greater impairment) were related to greater grey matter volume in left superior frontal gyrus, frontal pole, and right middle frontal …",

                "abstract": "While the newborn’s brain is functionally organised early on—with similar resting state networks as those of adults present at birth—these networks continue to develop at different rates and in complex ways over time. While most in vivo functional imaging studies examine the spatial characteristics of resting state networks (RSNs), such as their size or the degree of connectivity, the temporal characteristics of these networks are less well characterised. We set out to examine the long-range temporal correlation (LRTC) of the fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal using the Hurst exponent in various RSNs in infants born very preterm shortly after birth (< 32 weeks gestational age; n = 64) and again later at term equivalent age (TEA) (n = 69). The Hurst exponent in grey matter and white matter was 0.69 at preterm age and increased significantly to 0.80 at TEA, with a greater difference between the tissues at TEA. The Hurst exponent in RSNs similarly was found to be approximately 0.68 for most networks at preterm age but increased significantly at different rates by TEA: 0.77 and 0.76 in the cerebellum and frontal networks respectively, and 0.84 and 0.83 in the motor and visual networks respectively. This pattern is partly consistent with findings from previous functional connectivity fMRI studies that the general growth and maturation of RSNs occur first and develop more quickly in sensory and motor networks, but later in associative networks like frontal ones. Importantly, this is the first time that this pattern has been shown in the LRTC of the fMRI BOLD signal itself, an area of study that may provide greater insight into functional brain …",

However, there is no agreed standard method of acquisition and analysis. Therefore, we examined the fractal dimension (FD) of the brain's blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal over time, with varying time points, MRI k-space filling techniques, repetition times (TR), and scan lengths. Furthermore, fractal dimension was determined with two different approaches: relative dispersion (FD RD), and power spectrum (FD PS) techniques. At a reduced number of time points, FD RD is resistant to differing TR. FD PS is time-point invariant at a low TR (250 ms). With constant scan times, FD PS is the least variable. Our results show that some constraints to FD measurement in the brain require a certain amount of consistency in …",

Ca2+ that enters through voltage-gated CaV2. 2 channels and binds to a calcium sensor at the transmitter release site links membrane depolarization to activation of synaptic vesicle discharge. Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that the release site calcium sensor is within the single CaV2. 2 channel domain. Thus, modeling presynaptic nanophysiology requires knowledge of the channel transport rate at physiological [Ca2+] ext. However, this value has only been determined previously for the non-presynaptic CaV1. x (L type) channel with a conductance of~ 2.4 pS at [Ca2+] ext= 2 mM (Church and Stanley, JP 1996).

The study objective was to determine if the Hurst exponent (H) — an estimate of the self-correlation and signal complexity — of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal is correlated with the excitatory-inhibitory (E:I) ratio. E:I has been proposed to serve as a control parameter for brain criticality — the theory that the brain operates near a critical point between order and disorder, optimizing information processing and adaptability — which H is believed to be a measure of. Thus, understanding if H and E:I are correlated would clarify this relationship. Moreover, findings in this domain have implications for neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions with disrupted E:I balance, such as autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s disease. From a practical perspective, H is easier to accurately measure than E:I ratio at 3T MRI. If H can serve as a proxy for E:I, it may serve as a more practical clinical biomarker for this imbalance and for neuroscience research in general. The study collected functional MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy data during rest and movie-watching. H was found to increase with movie-watching compared to rest, while E:I (glutamate/GABA) did not change between conditions. H and E:I were not correlated during either movie-watching or rest. This study represents the first attempt to investigate this connection in vivo in humans. We conclude that, at 3T and with our particular methodologies, no …",

Children with DCD (N= 78) were randomized to either a treatment or waitlist group and underwent three MRIs over 6 months. The treatment group received intervention (once weekly for 10 weeks) between the first and second scan; the waitlist group received intervention between the second and third scan. Cortical grey matter volume was measured using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Behavioral outcome measures included the Performance Quality Rating Scale (PQRS) and Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-2 (BOT-2). Of the 78 children, 58 were excluded (mostly due to insufficient data quality), leaving a final N= 20 for analyses. Due to the small sample size, we combined both groups to examine treatment effects. Cortical grey matter volume differences were assessed using a repeated measures ANOVA, controlling for total intracranial volume. Regression analyses examined the relationship of grey matter volume changes to BOT-2 (motor performance) and PQRS (movement quality).Results: After CO-OP, children had significantly decreased grey matter in the right superior frontal gyrus and middle/posterior cingulate gyri. We found no significant associations of grey matter volume changes with PQRS or BOT-2 scores.Conclusion: Decreased cortical grey matter volume generally reflects greater brain maturity.

This paper focuses on the anatomical scans, performing VBM of cortical grey matter volume in 30 children with DCD and 12 TD children. Preprocessing and VBM data analysis were conducted using the Computational Anatomy Tool Box-12 and a study-specific brain template. Differences between DCD and TD groups were assessed using a one-way ANOVA, controlling for total intracranial volume. Regression analyses examined if motor and/or attentional difficulties predicted grey matter volume. We used threshold-free cluster enhancement (5,000 permutations) and set an alpha level of 0.05. Due to the small sample size, we did not correct for multiple comparisons.Results: Compared to the TD group, children with DCD had significantly greater grey matter in the left superior frontal gyrus. Lower motor scores (meaning greater impairment) were related to greater grey matter volume in left superior frontal gyrus, frontal pole, and right middle frontal gyrus. Greater grey matter volume was also significantly correlated with higher scores on the Conners 3 ADHD Index in the left superior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobe, and precuneus. These results indicate that greater grey matter volume in these regions is associated with poorer motor and attentional skills.Discussion: Greater grey matter volume in the left superior frontal gyrus in children with DCD may be a result of delayed or absent healthy cortical thinning, potentially due to altered synaptic pruning as seen in …",

                "abstract": "The human brain is possibly the most complicated structure in the known world. It contains 100 billion neurons, each making contact with 1,000 to 10,000 other neurons. The neurons themselves have hundreds of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters / receptors with which to use to activate or de-activate other neighbouring neurons. Ultimately these neurons are organized into locally defined functional neural networks, which in turn connect with other neural networks to create non-localized highly-complex brain circuits. These brain circuits are responsible for the higher order functions such as perception, emotions, learning, language and conscious thought. In healthy brain states, these networks and circuits are communicating and signalling appropriately. With mental illness, or in an intoxicated brain state, however, this network and circuit functioning can become disrupted: either in a very specific manner, or in a generalized form. Alcohol (in the form of ethanol) is one of the oldest and most widely used psychoactive drugs in the world. In recreational doses, it can have drastic effects on how a person thinks and behaves. Small doses will lead to feelings of euphoria, increased sociability, and impaired judgement, while larger doses will lead to impaired memory and comprehension, and at extreme doses will lead from confusion and stupor to coma and death. The current understanding of alcohol’s effects on the brain is that it acts in a very specific way on a variety of brain enzymes and receptors. This in turn affects specific brain circuitries, making alcohol intoxication a promising model of pharmacological neural network and brain circuit …",

Since the L> N> T hierarchy was determined with high Ba 2+ EXT, we tested the idea that this sequence may differ at physiological Ca 2+ EXT.We recorded i values for all three Ca V families across a broad range of Ca 2+ EXT, spanning the physiological range.

In this work, a database comprising these outcome measures in a healthy population (n= 51) was established to potentially serve as a comparative reference. Healthy individuals underwent standardized procedures to ensure consistent collection of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy data. The MR data was acquired using a 3T scanner with various sequences, including MPRAGE 3D T1w, pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling (pCASL), and single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). Established and custom software tools were employed to analyze outcome measures such as tissue segmentation, cortical thickness, cerebral blood flow, metabolite levels, and temperature estimated using MRS.

                "abstract": "A PCA analysis of fractional anistropy (FA) was conducted from a sample of schizophrenia patients (n= 42) and healthy controls (n= 40) resulted in three major components:“corpus callosum”,“internal capsule/temporal/brainstem”, and “corona radiata”. Average component scores did not differ as a function of group, but a correlation of PSYRATS scores and principal components revealed the frequency, amount of distress associated with voices, and disruption associated with voices correlated significantly with the corpus callosum component. Our findings suggest that reduced interhemispheric connectivity of the prefrontal cortex is related to hallucination severity in schizophrenia, perhaps mediated through top-down processes such as source monitoring.",
