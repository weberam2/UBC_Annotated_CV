Neonates, who are born with very little myelin and iron, and an underdeveloped connectome, provide researchers with an opportunity to investigate whether R2* is intimately linked with fibre‐angle or myelin content as it is in adults, which may in future studies be explored as a potential white matter developmental biomarker.

What is not clear from these studies, however, is how myelin is affected: whether it becomes degraded and possibly removed, or whether the myelin sheath loosens and becomes “decompacted”. Previously, our team revealed myelin specific changes in ice hockey players 2 weeks post-concussion using myelin water imaging. In that study, 45 subjects underwent a pre-season baseline scan, 11 of which sustained a concussion during play and received follow-up scans: eight were scanned within 3 days, 10 were scanned at 14 days, and nine were scanned at 60 days. In the current retrospective analysis, we used quantitative susceptibility mapping, along with the diffusion tensor imaging measures axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity, to investigate this myelin disruption. If sports-related concussive hits lead to myelin fragmentation in regions of lowered MWF, this should result in a measurable increase in magnetic susceptibility, due to the anisotropic myelin fragmenting into isotropic myelin debris, and the diamagnetic myelin tissue being removed, while no such changes should be expected if the myelin sheath simply loosens and becomes decompacted. An increase in radial diffusivity would likewise reveal myelin fragmentation, as myelin sheaths block water diffusion out of the axon, with little to no changes expected for myelin sheath loosening. Statistical analysis of the same voxels-of-interest that were found to have reduced myelin water fraction 2 weeks post …",

Like natural phenomena such as the growth of a tree or crashing ocean waves, the brain expresses scale‐invariant, or fractal, patterns in neural signals that can be measured. While neural phenomena may represent both monofractal and multifractal processes and can be quantified with many different interrelated parameters, this review will focus on monofractal analysis using the Hurst exponent (H). Monofractal analysis of fMRI data is an advanced analysis technique that measures the complexity of brain signaling by quantifying its degree of scale‐invariance. As such, the H value of the blood oxygenation level‐dependent (BOLD) signal specifies how the degree of correlation …",

As opposed to more severe TBI, in which complete axon severance is observed following high-magnitude impacts, it is thought that axonal and myelin disorder in mTBI takes days to weeks to …",

However, in contrast with what would be predicted from the earlier report, GST–LIM1-3 did not enhance but instead blocked the action of the PKC activator (Fig. 1).Although we have not explored this action further, we speculate that this effect might be most simply attributed to binding of LIM1–3 to PKC and its removal as a potential CaV2. 2 modulating agent. This finding prompted us to retest whether PDLIM5 is a component of a molecular complex with CaV2. 2 by biochemical and immunocytochemical analysis. This was facilitated by the availability of a new commercially available selective polyclonal mouse antibody to PDLIM5,",

In previous studies, orientation effects of R2 relaxation in the mature brain's white matter have been found to be described by a susceptibility-based model of diffusion through local magnetic field inhomogeneities created by the diamagnetic myelin sheaths. Orientation effects in human newborn white matter have not yet been investigated. The newborn brain is known to contain very little myelin and is therefore expected to exhibit a decrease in orientation dependence driven by susceptibility-based effects. We measured R2 orientation dependence in the white matter of human newborns.

Monofractal analysis quantifies this scaling behavior in a single parameter, the Hurst exponent (H). Higher H reflects greater correlation in the signal structure, which is taken as being more fractal. Previous fMRI studies have observed lower H during conventional tasks relative to resting state conditions, and shown that H is negatively correlated with task difficulty and novelty. To date, no study has investigated the fractal dynamics of BOLD signal during naturalistic conditions.Methods: We performed fractal analysis on Human Connectome Project 7T fMRI data (n = 72, 41 females, mean age 29.46 ± 3.76 years) to compare H across movie-watching and rest.Results: In contrast to previous work using conventional tasks, we found higher H values for movie relative to rest (mean difference = 0.014; p = 5.279 × 10−7; 95% CI [0.009, 0.019]). H was significantly higher in movie than rest in the visual, somatomotor and dorsal attention networks, but was significantly lower during movie in the frontoparietal and default networks. We found no cross-condition differences in test-retest reliability of H. Finally, we found that H of movie-derived stimulus properties (e.g., luminance changes) were fractal whereas H of head motion estimates were non-fractal.Conclusions: Overall, our findings suggest that movie-watching induces fractal signal dynamics. In line with recent work characterizing connectivity-based brain state dynamics during movie-watching, we speculate that these fractal dynamics reflect the configuring and reconfiguring of brain states …",

The purpose of this study was to investigate cortical grey matter volume using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in children with DCD compared to TD children.This cross-sectional study was part of a larger randomized-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02597751) that involved various MRI scans of children with/without DCD. This paper focuses on the anatomical scans, performing VBM of cortical grey matter volume in 30 children with DCD and 12 TD children. Preprocessing and VBM data analysis were conducted using the Computational Anatomy Tool Box-12 and a study-specific brain template. Differences between DCD and TD groups were assessed using a one-way ANOVA, controlling for total intracranial volume. Regression analyses examined if motor and/or attentional difficulties predicted grey matter volume. We used threshold-free cluster enhancement (5,000 permutations) and set an alpha level of 0.05. Due to the small sample size, we did not correct for multiple comparisons.Compared to the TD group, children with DCD had significantly greater grey matter in the left superior frontal gyrus. Lower motor scores (meaning greater impairment) were related to greater grey matter volume in left superior frontal gyrus, frontal pole, and right middle frontal …",

In clinical practice, ID and iron supplementation are not routinely considered in the diagnostic work-up and/or as a treatment option in such conditions. Therefore, we conducted a scoping literature review of ID guidelines. Of the 58 guidelines included, only 9 included RLS, and 3 included ADHD. Ferritin was the most frequently cited biomarker, though cutoff values varied between guidelines and depending on additional factors such as age, sex, and comorbidities. Recommendations surrounding measurable iron biomarkers and cutoff values varied between guidelines; moreover, despite capturing the role of inflammation as a concept, most guidelines often did not include recommendations for how to assess this. This lack of harmonization on the interpretation of iron and inflammation biomarkers raises questions about the applicability of current guidelines in clinical practice. Further, the majority of ID guidelines in this review did not include the ID-associated disorders, ADHD and RLS. As ID can be associated with altered movement patterns, a novel consensus is needed for investigating and interpreting iron status in the context of different clinical phenotypes.",

Therefore, we examined the fractal dimension (FD) of the brain's blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal over time, with varying time points, MRI k-space filling techniques, repetition times (TR), and scan lengths. Furthermore, fractal dimension was determined with two different approaches: relative dispersion (FD RD), and power spectrum (FD PS) techniques. At a reduced number of time points, FD RD is resistant to differing TR. FD PS is time-point invariant at a low TR (250 ms). With constant scan times, FD PS is the least variable.

This paper focuses on the anatomical scans, performing VBM of cortical grey matter volume in 30 children with DCD and 12 TD children. Preprocessing and VBM data analysis were conducted using the Computational Anatomy Tool Box-12 and a study-specific brain template. Differences between DCD and TD groups were assessed using a one-way ANOVA, controlling for total intracranial volume. Regression analyses examined if motor and/or attentional difficulties predicted grey matter volume. We used threshold-free cluster enhancement (5,000 permutations) and set an alpha level of 0.05. Due to the small sample size, we did not correct for multiple comparisons.Results: Compared to the TD group, children with DCD had significantly greater grey matter in the left superior frontal gyrus. Lower motor scores (meaning greater impairment) were related to greater grey matter volume in left superior frontal gyrus, frontal pole, and right middle frontal gyrus. Greater grey matter volume was also significantly correlated with higher scores on the Conners 3 ADHD Index in the left superior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobe, and precuneus. These results indicate that greater grey matter volume in these regions is associated with poorer motor and attentional skills.Discussion: Greater grey matter volume in the left superior frontal gyrus in children with DCD may be a result of delayed or absent healthy cortical thinning, potentially due to altered synaptic pruning as seen in …",

                "abstract": "The human brain is possibly the most complicated structure in the known world. It contains 100 billion neurons, each making contact with 1,000 to 10,000 other neurons. The neurons themselves have hundreds of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters / receptors with which to use to activate or de-activate other neighbouring neurons. Ultimately these neurons are organized into locally defined functional neural networks, which in turn connect with other neural networks to create non-localized highly-complex brain circuits. These brain circuits are responsible for the higher order functions such as perception, emotions, learning, language and conscious thought. In healthy brain states, these networks and circuits are communicating and signalling appropriately. With mental illness, or in an intoxicated brain state, however, this network and circuit functioning can become disrupted: either in a very specific manner, or in a generalized form. Alcohol (in the form of ethanol) is one of the oldest and most widely used psychoactive drugs in the world. In recreational doses, it can have drastic effects on how a person thinks and behaves. Small doses will lead to feelings of euphoria, increased sociability, and impaired judgement, while larger doses will lead to impaired memory and comprehension, and at extreme doses will lead from confusion and stupor to coma and death. The current understanding of alcohol’s effects on the brain is that it acts in a very specific way on a variety of brain enzymes and receptors. This in turn affects specific brain circuitries, making alcohol intoxication a promising model of pharmacological neural network and brain circuit …",

Methods We obtained mean R2*, RD and AD within the whole white matter of 19 term infants with clinical diagnosis of HIE and 12 healthy controls. Results R2*, RD and AD did not differ significantly between the healthy controls and infants with HIE. R2* did not associate with the clinical predictors of HIE. Reduced R2* was correlated with increased RD and AD. Conclusion R2*, RD and AD do not show a clear relationship with clinically defined HIE.",

We attempted to replicate their findings with retrospective mTBI data of our own. We did not find any significant differences with controls, and ice hockey athletes concussed after two weeks. We also did not find any changes in concussed athletes comparing data before injury with data after 3 days, 2 weeks, and 2 months.",

These biomarkers could in turn help determine the health, disease state, or developmental progress of white matter tissue, with many potential benefits to diagnosis, treatment, and therapeutic research. As opposed to adults who show a remarkable fit of R2* against fibre orientation, neonates showed very little dependence on myelin or fibre orientation.",

Average component scores did not differ as a function of group, but a correlation of PSYRATS scores and principal components revealed the frequency, amount of distress associated with voices, and disruption associated with voices correlated significantly with the corpus callosum component. Our findings suggest that reduced interhemispheric connectivity of the prefrontal cortex is related to hallucination severity in schizophrenia, perhaps mediated through top-down processes such as source monitoring.",
